"""Writes THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt: the licences of the works built into the plug-in's
binaries, which their licences ask to accompany every copy (decisions.md R17).

The crates are those `ca72-plugin` links (normal dependencies, not build scripts, tests or
procedural macros) on any platform it is released for, read from `cargo metadata` and
Cargo.lock, with the licence files each crate ships; a crate that ships none gets its
licence's standard text with its authors. The Rust standard library, built into every Rust
binary, the panel's font and the macOS Audio Unit's wrapper (third_party, decisions.md R30)
follow. Run it after any change to the dependencies, to rust-toolchain.toml or to the
vendored wrapper:

    python3 scripts/notices.py           # writes THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt
    python3 scripts/notices.py --check   # fails if the file is out of date (CI)
