//! The panel as drawn matches the design the owner approved (`approved.png`: the mock-up at one
//! panel unit a pixel, every control at half its travel). The switch column between MIXER and
//! MODIFIERS (the mock-up's x 2100 to 2330, y 225 to 690) is the renderer's own, as the owner
//! chose it on 2026-10-09 with FILTER MODE at its head (decisions.md R46). The mock-up had the
//! left hand's controls in a column left of the panel, 330 units wide; they are on the strip
//! below now (A6, R44), so the panel is compared with the mock-up right of its column. The
//! name board under the face is gone (the plate moved up into the top strip, R44): the top
//! strip and the face are compared, the plate's place there left out. The last column's head,
//! above POWER's lamp, is left out: QUALITY, its toggle and ULTRA's lamp came after the mock-up
//! and were approved in their own (decisions.md R47, R48).
//!
//! The large lettering (R-LETTERING, a setting) is compared with `approved-large.png`: the
//! same mock-up, but where the large lettering changes the drawing, the renderer's pixels, as
//! the owner approved them on 2026-10-15 (as the switch column has the renderer's).
//!
//! Oscillators 2's and 3's TIMED keys (decisions.md R-OSC-TIMED) came after the mock-up and were
//! approved in their own: in both pictures, the renderer's pixels round each key (dimmed, as at
//! 8'), as of 2026-10-20.
