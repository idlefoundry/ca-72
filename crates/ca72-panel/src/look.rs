//! A look: what the editor's panel is drawn with (decisions.md R-SKIN-PACKS). It is one of the
//! two built in, CLASSIC and REALISTIC, or a skin pack's: a folder of artwork and declarative
//! appearance data in the format every pack uses (`docs/skin-packs.md`; the built-in two are
//! packs too, `packs/official/`). A pack brings no code: the open-source renderer draws the
//! controls, the pack says where they are and what they look like.
//!
//! A pack is untrusted input. It is read and checked by `skin_pack` (its paths, its files'
//! kinds and sizes, its SVG, its fonts, its manifest), then here: its `[look]` table, its
//! layout (`crate::arrangement`), its pictures' slots, and whether its fonts print every legend
//! and fit them on the panel. A pack that fails is not loaded, and the editor draws the
//! built-in look instead; nothing a look does reaches the sound, the presets, automation or
//! what a session saves (the look chosen is the computer's setting, not the session's).
