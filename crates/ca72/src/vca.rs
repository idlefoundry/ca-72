//! Board 4's VCAs and output stage (circuit No. 7) in real time, derived from its circuit
//! (docs/circuit/board4.md, `circuits/boards/board4-vca.lib`). Figure 9-11's reference
//! designators.
//!
//! - **Signal path**: the filter's output through R2 and C6 against R34 (a 1/197 divider)
//!   into the first pair Q16/Q15; its collectors (R19/R23 and the 1st VCA BAL trim R14 to
//!   the chain's node nn) drive the second pair Q14/Q13; its collectors (R18/R21 and the
//!   2nd VCA BAL trim R12 to nm; the A-440's R40 and C8 on Q14's) drive the PNP output pair
//!   Q12/Q17 (R8/R28 to Q1, a current source); Q17's collector current into R29 is the
//!   output, through C2 and R77 to the load. Each pair is a tanh behind its series drop
//!   (RB, RE, R8) and its source resistances against its base currents, which is also how
//!   the trims set the pairs' balance.
//! - **Tails**: Q18 from the loudness contour (R59, R37, R43; its collector through R35
//!   under the first pair: it saturates near a 5 V contour, so the gain peaks there), Q21
//!   from EXT. LOUDNESS (J3's 33K to +10 V when the jack is empty), Q1 from the chain's
//!   first node nl through R9: full Gummel-Poon transistors, solved at the control rate.
//! - **The supply chain** (R10 with C4, R11, R13, R22, R36 with C15) carries the pairs'
//!   load currents: the first pair's tail lowers nl, which raises Q1's current and so the
//!   output's resting voltage (the circuit's thump), over C4's and C15's time constants.
//!
//! Signal couplings (C6, C8, C2) and the chain (C4, C15) are states, integrated by the
//! trapezoidal rule; the pairs are algebraic. Left out: the transistors' capacitances
//! (their nodes are 100 to 400 ohm) and CR1/CR2, which R29 keeps from conducting.
