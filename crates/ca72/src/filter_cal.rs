//! The filter's factory calibration (Folkman 1973, the owner's choice; board4.md):
//! "Regeneration Cal." (R73), "Filter Range" (R39) and "Filter Scale" (R49), done on the
//! real-time filter as the procedure does it on the instrument: by listening to the filter
//! oscillate and zero-beating it against the A-440.
//!
//! The trims depend only on the circuit, not the panel, so the procedure's result is kept
