//! The model's iterative solves that stopped at their cap without converging, counted
//! on each thread by solver; tests require none. Such a solve leaves its last iterate, which
//! can be off by more than its tolerance: No Compromises' contours held their transistors'
//! steps to 0.2 V and stopped short 447 times in the worst case's 3 s (up to 5e-6 V at the
//! contours) before this counted them. The nodal solver's failures are counted by the
//! circuits that own one (`failed`); Potato's filter stops at two iterations by design and
//! is not counted.
