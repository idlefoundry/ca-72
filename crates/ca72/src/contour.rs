//! Board 2's dual contour generator (circuit No. 8) in real time, derived from its circuit
//! (docs/circuit/board2.md, `circuits/boards/board2-contour.lib`). Figure 9-7's
//! reference designators; the loudness section's in brackets where they differ.
//!
//! - **Trigger**: a key joins the trigger bus to +10 V; the bus charges C7 through the
//!   germanium CR10 and R60, and C7 drives Q20's base through R55. At rest CR10's leakage
//!   holds C7 near -10 V, so C7 must charge past Q20's threshold first (a few
//!   milliseconds); after the key is released Q20 stays on until C7 has drained into its
//!   base (about 12 ms). Q20 pulls down the reset line (R37); Q12 (through R19) inverts it
//!   into V-trig, whose rise sets both flip-flops through C1 [C4].
//! - **Flip-flop** Q1/Q4 [Q25/Q15]: set, Q5 [Q16] charges the timing capacitor C5 [C2]
//!   through R7 [R42] and the ATTACK pot toward +9.3 V; the flip-flop resets when the
//!   output, divided by R33/R29 [R24/R27] toward -10 V, drives enough current through CR3
//!   [CR6] into Q4's [Q15's] base to take Q1 [Q25] out of saturation, or while the reset
//!   line drives it through CR1 [CR8].
//! - **Decay**: reset, Q7 [Q18] (saturated) lets the capacitor discharge through the DECAY
//!   pot into the sustain node, held by the PNP follower Q8 [Q19] at the SUSTAIN divider's
//!   voltage; on release V-trig pulls the node down through CR2 [CR9] (DECAY on: the final
//!   decay at the DECAY time) and, with DECAY off, dumps the capacitor through CR7 [CR4]
//!   and R1401 1.5K: each capacitor through one of its own, as the hardware reference
//!   does (`ContourCircuit::dump_each`), or both through the drawing's one.
//! - **Output**: Q22 and Q21, a complementary follower [Q3 and Q2, a Darlington], whose
//!   drop follows from its transistors at the load's current.
//!
//! The flip-flops are latches (their transitions take microseconds); everything else is
//! the circuit's equations, solved every sample. The +9.3 V rail is ideal at its resting
//! value (its decoupling is not modelled; docs/circuit/assumptions.md).
