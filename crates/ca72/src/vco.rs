//! One oscillator of board 1 in real time: the exponential converter ([`crate::expo`]),
//! the sawtooth core with its reset, and the wave shapers (docs/circuit/board1.md).
//!
//! How each part is derived:
//! - **Timing current**: [`ExpoCircuit`] solves the converter's circuit equations at the
//!   ramp's two ends once per output sample; the current is linear in the ramp's voltage
//!   (the Early effect, amplified slightly by R42's feedback), so the ramp integrates
//!   exactly between events.
//! - **Core**: C1 plus the ramp node's junction capacitances integrates the current; when
//!   the ramp falls through the Schmitt trigger's threshold the reset follows after the
//!   comparator's delay (it grows as the ramp slows), the ramp jumps to its top (which
//!   falls slightly as the ramp speeds up) and holds while Q10 releases. These constants
//!   are extracted from ngspice runs of the transcribed circuit ([`CoreParams::default`],
//!   `scripts/fit_core.py`); they explain ngspice's period within 0.11 cent from
//!   0.7 Hz to 4.2 kHz.
//! - **Shapers**: the buffer (Q7-Q3) is linear; the sawtooth is its divided output; the
//!   triangle is the DC transfer of Q2/Q1 tabulated from ngspice ([`crate::tables::TRI`]);
//!   the rectangle is Q11/Q12's comparator with its hysteresis, thresholds from ngspice's
//!   DC sweeps.
//! - **Band-limiting** (decisions.md R-BLEP): the core runs at `oversample` times the output
//!   rate; the jumps at the reset and the rectangle's edges get band-limited steps at their
//!   exact times, the reset's areas band-limited impulses, and the slope's jumps (the reset,
//!   the hold's end, the triangle's fold as a rounded corner) band-limited ramps, all from one
//!   windowed sinc ([`crate::resample::BlepLine`]); a halfband decimator brings each output
//!   down, its last stage long enough to keep 20 Hz to 20 kHz clean at 44.1 kHz
//!   ([`Decimator::for_oscillators`]). Only the outputs in use are corrected ([`Vco::set_outputs`]).
//!
//! Outputs are the board's open-circuit voltages (unloaded): the mixer's loading belongs
//! to the mixer's model. The reset's sub-microsecond shape is represented by what it does
//! below 20 kHz: its timing, and the areas it adds to the triangle (the glitch as the
//! buffer sweeps through Q2's fold) and to the sawtooth (the buffer's lag), measured on
//! the reference. Left out: the core's temperature dependence (its thresholds are 25 C's)
//! and noise.
