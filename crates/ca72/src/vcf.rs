//! Board 4's filter (circuit No. 6) in real time, derived from its circuit
//! (docs/circuit/board4.md). Figure 9-11's reference designators.
//!
//! - **Control**: the control node is a passive sum of the front panel's resistors against
//!   the SCALE network (R49, R70) and Q26's base current; Q26 (PNP) and Q28 (NPN) make the
//!   ladder's current, exponential in the node's voltage ([`FilterExpo`]).
//! - **Ladder**: from the transistors' exponential law and each node's current balance, the
//!   differential voltage x_k across stage k's capacitor obeys
//!   2C dx_1/dt = -E1 (tanh(D / 2Vt) + tanh(x_1 / 2Vt)) (D: the input pair's base
//!   difference) and 2C dx_k/dt = Ek (tanh(x_(k-1) / 2Vt) - tanh(x_k / 2Vt)), where Ek is
//!   stage k's emitter current: what the stage below passes on after its base currents.
//!   Each pair's tanh sits behind its series drop (RE, RB against the base currents; for
//!   the input pair also R54 and R73/R76 against its base currents), its Vt is raised by
//!   high injection (IKF), and each stage's C carries half its nodes' junction and
//!   diffusion capacitances ([`VcfCircuit::bias`]).
//! - **Input**: the mixer's bus drives C27 into R54 and the bias chain's bottom (b5: R67,
//!   the chain above it, C24), which the emphasis current also returns to.
//! - **Output**: C5/C1 couple the top capacitor's voltage (a 15 Hz high-pass) into the
//!   followers Q8/Q6 and the pair Q7/Q5: the gain recovery amplifier, tabulated from its
//!   DC transfer ([`crate::tables::OUT_DI`]; its operating point is offset, so it clips
//!   asymmetrically, and Q8 saturates on the positive side). The followers' base currents
//!   ([`crate::tables::OUT_DIB`]) and R31/R38 load the ladder's top stage. R7's top (nt)
//!   is held by R6 and C9, not an AC ground below 100 Hz.
//! - **Emphasis**: R7/R3's junction, through C10, the EMPHASIS rheostat R14, R73 and R76,
//!   drives Q30's base.
//!
//! - **FILTER MODE** (not on the original; decisions.md R46, `filter-mode.lib`): the
//!   hardware reference's high-pass. HI is the mixer's output less the filter's: the bus's
//!   Norton current through [`MODE_RT`] (the filter's own passband at EMPHASIS 0) and a
//!   coupling of [`MODE_HZ`], less the output above. LO is the output as drawn.
//!
//! The whole loop (nine states: [`STATES`]) is solved without delay: trapezoidal
//! integration, Newton's method, at `oversample` times the output rate, with the ladder's
//! corner prewarped ([`Vcf::prewarp_hz`]). Left out: the output stage's transistor
//! capacitances (docs/circuit/assumptions.md A11).
