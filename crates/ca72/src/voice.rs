//! The instrument, first voice (v0): the parts derived and tested so far, wired as the
//! instrument wires them (docs/circuit/voice.md).
//!
//! - **Keyboard** (board 2's keyboard circuit, [`crate::keyboard`]): 44 keys; the lowest
//!   and highest held join the pitch bus to the string (lowest-note priority follows); the
//!   trigger contact is closed while any key is held (single triggering); the hold,
//!   GLIDE, and the output's load (the oscillators' and the filter's keyboard inputs). A

//! - **Oscillators 1, 2 and 3** (board 1, each tuned by Folkman's 1973 procedure on the
//!   model, its keys played through the keyboard circuit): oscillator 2 with its FREQUENCY
//!   control, oscillator 3 with its FREQUENCY control, OSC. 3 CONTROL (its control stage IC8)
//!   and its reverse sawtooth (Q37). Each through its WAVEFORM switch (dwg 1448: triangle,

//!   sawtooth, rectangle at 0, -1.5 and -2.5 V of width bias) and the mixer's VOLUME pot
//!   (25K linear) and 33K onto the bus, as a Norton source. The external input (33K) and the

//! - **Filter** (board 4) with its control node: CUTOFF (5K linear across +/-10 V) through

//!   linear from the filter contour) through R74 47K; EMPHASIS (R14, 50K reverse audio,
//!   a rheostat).
//! - **VCA** (board 4, balanced by the factory procedure) on the loudness contour.
//! - **Contours** (board 2), at half the output rate, interpolated.
//!
//! The front panel's pot tapers are generic audio and reverse audio laws (assumptions A9;
//! GLIDE is "R2 5M AUDIO" on Figure 9-17).
