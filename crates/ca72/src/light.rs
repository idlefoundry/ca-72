//! Potato mode's voice (decisions.md R31): the instrument's panel played by a model far
//! cheaper than the circuit's, for computers the circuit is too heavy for. Not derived from
//! the circuit but fitted to the circuit model's measured behaviour ([`laws`]; the plug-in's
//! `tests/potato_reference.rs` measures both): band-limited oscillators (polyBLEP) at the
//! circuit's levels and shapes, the mixer's channels through their loaded pots, the input
//! pair's compression, one ladder of four one-pole stages solved without delay around the
//! loop (its gain the emphasis, its own limiter setting how loud it rings), FILTER MODE HI
//! (the bus less the filter), the plug-in's DRIVE, contours of RC segments with the circuit's
//! time laws and trigger, and the VCA's measured law. The audio
//! path runs in single precision at the voice's rate; what the panel and the contours set
//! (the oscillators' increments, the ladder's coefficient) is worked out every
//! [`CONTROL_EVERY`] samples and followed between.
//!
//! The keys are the instrument's: lowest-note priority, single triggering (a key pressed while
//! another is held does not start the contours again), the contours re-armed once the trigger
//! contact has been open 11.5 ms; GLIDE moves the pitch as the circuit's hold does. Nothing here
//! allocates once made.
