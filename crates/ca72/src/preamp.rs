//! Board 4's external preamplifier and overload lamp driver (circuit No. 12,
//! `board4-preamp.lib`; docs/circuit/board4.md) in real time, solved as their circuit by
//! the nodal solver ([`crate::mna`]).
//!
//! The EXTERNAL INPUT's volume (R9, 1M audio) is a Thevenin source into pin 11; the
//! preamplifier (gain about 200) runs at four trapezoidal substeps a sample (its closed loop
//! reaches past 50 kHz), its input upsampled and its outputs decimated by the halfband
//! resamplers ([`crate::resample`]; their delay is [`Preamp::latency`]). Its
//! output reaches the mixer's bus through C20, SW10 and R46 33K. The lamp driver runs once a
//! sample from the preamplifier's output (R53's load on the output is left out: the output
//! is the feedback loop's, a few ohms).
