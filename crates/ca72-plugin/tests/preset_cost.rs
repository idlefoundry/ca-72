//! What each factory preset costs with POLY's ten voices (decisions.md R10, "POLY in real
//! time"): the engine as a host calls it, 256-frame blocks at 48 kHz, ten-note chords
//! changing every half second (each held seven eighths of it), run as fast as it goes on one
//! thread (not paced, not promoted). Prints, per preset, the share of one core that real
//! time takes, and how many voices that leaves room for in 60 % of a block's period (the
//! strip's figure).
//!
//! By hand: `cargo test --release -p ca72-plugin --test preset_cost -- --ignored
//! --nocapture` (`CA72_SECONDS`, 4; `CA72_VOICES`, 10; `CA72_ONLY`, a part of a preset's
//! name; `CA72_NO_FEEDBACK`, set: FEEDBACK at 0; `CA72_DOUBLE`, DOUBLE's amount in %, 0).
