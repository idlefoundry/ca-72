//! POLY's voices on worker threads of the plug-in's own (decisions.md R11): the host's audio
//! thread and a few workers (up to four) share each run of samples' voices, every voice played whole by
//! one of them, and the host's thread sums them in the voices' order, so the output is the
//! same to the bit as with every voice on the host's thread.
//!
//! Safe Rust only, as `ca72::threaded`: each voice sits behind a mutex that the audio thread
//! only ever tries (a voice is free whenever no one has taken it for the run at hand); a run
//! is offered through atomics. One word holds the run's number, its voices and the next one
//! to take, so whoever takes a voice takes it by a compare-and-swap on the word, and a
//! worker late from an earlier run can take nothing from a later one. The audio thread takes
//! voices too, until none is left: any voice no worker has started, it plays itself. It then
//! waits for the workers' voices until the block's deadline, spinning, then yielding, then
//! sleeping a little at a time ([`Backoff`]; on Windows it goes on yielding); a voice not
//! done by then is silent for that run and sits out until its worker lets it go. Once the
//! deadline has passed, the block's further runs are not offered: the audio thread plays them.
//! Nothing here allocates once the workers are started.
//!
//! A run is over when its player returns, and the word says so: a worker held up between
//! taking a voice and locking it, which finds its run over (the engine may have listed the
//! voice again meanwhile, its keys and panel brought up), leaves the voice as it is. The mark
//! of the run a voice last played for is written only by the worker holding the voice, so a
//! late worker cannot overwrite a later run's (decisions.md R18).
//!
//! The workers are started off the audio thread and run at the audio threads' priority
//! (`ca72_rt::promote`: on macOS the time-constraint policy for the host's block period). On
//! macOS they also join a work interval of their own, which the first of them opens at a
//! block's first run and closes when the block's runs are done: without it the system ran
//! them, busy a third of each period, about half as fast as a thread busy for most of it
//! (decisions.md R11). A plug-in cannot join its host's audio workgroup:
//! neither VST3 nor nih-plug's CLAP hands one over. They spin a moment after a run (the next
//! run of the block follows at once) and park after it; the audio thread wakes them for each
//! run. A run carries the audio thread's floating-point flush bits (nih-plug's flush-to-zero),
//! which a worker takes before it plays.
//!
//! Workers made audio threads come out of one budget for the process: all instances' together
//! are at most [`crate::engine::default_workers`]. An instance given fewer plays the rest on
//! the host's thread; a pool's go back when it stops (decisions.md R18). An instance holds a
//! pool only while POLY is on: its audio thread asks for one and lets it go through a
//! [`Crew`], which the plug-in's helper thread serves, starting and stopping pools
//! (decisions.md R21, R23).
