//! The editor: the front panel (`ca72-panel`) in a window of its own (baseview), its frames
//! shown with softbuffer, and under it the plug-in's own strip (`ca72_panel::strip`, A6:
//! decisions.md R-LOOK): the presets' rail, the left hand's GLIDE, DECAY and wheels, MODE,
//! VOICES and ENTROPY, how the voices are played across the field, WIDTH, DETUNE and where the
//! voices sound, DRIVE, AUTO GAIN and LEVEL. Every control operates its parameter through the
//! host, a drag one gesture (one undo step in hosts that keep them); the POWER switch is the
//! bypass; the OVERLOAD lamp, the wheels and the voices' display show what the audio thread
//! reports. The grip at the window's bottom right corner resizes it. The presets' drawer drops
//! down from under the rail over the strip (`crate::presets`, decisions.md R10), the window
//! keeping its size, and takes the keyboard while open; in it the update check
//! (`crate::update`, R27). A right click opens a control's menu, for MIDI Learn; the drawer's
//! MIDI button shows its list of assignments (`crate::learning`, R34).
