//! The editor: the front panel (`ca72-panel`) in a window of its own (baseview), its frames
//! shown with softbuffer, and under it the plug-in's own strip (`ca72_panel::strip`, A6:
//! decisions.md R44): the presets' rail, the left hand's GLIDE, DECAY and wheels, MODE,
//! VOICES and ENTROPY, how the voices are played across the field, WIDTH, INNER, DETUNE and
//! where the voices sound, DRIVE, AUTO GAIN and LEVEL. Every control operates its parameter
//! through the host, a drag one gesture (one undo step in hosts that keep them); the POWER
//! switch is the bypass; the OVERLOAD lamp, the wheels and the voices' display show what the
//! audio thread reports. The grip at the window's bottom right corner resizes it. The presets'
//! drawer drops down from under the rail over the strip (`crate::presets`, decisions.md R10),
//! the window keeping its size, and takes the keyboard while open; in it the update check
//! (`crate::update`, R27). A right click opens a control's menu, for MIDI Learn; the drawer's
//! MIDI button shows its list of assignments (`crate::learning`, R34).
//! PANEL on the rail shows or hides the whole lower panel. The window snaps to its height;
//! opening presets temporarily reveals a hidden panel, closing them hides it again.
