//! The plug-in's own helper thread (decisions.md R23): it does for the audio thread what must
//! not be done there, mending the engine's spare voices ([`Spares::mend`]; R18) and starting
//! and stopping POLY's workers ([`Crew::serve`]; R21), when the audio thread asks, which
//! allocates nothing and does not wait (a bit set, an unpark). And AUTO GAIN's measurements
//! ([`Calibration::step`]; R-STEREO), when the editor asks, a render at a time with the audio
//! thread's asks seen to between them.
//!
//! nih-plug's background thread did this before. Shared by every instance, it holds the
//! plug-in alive while it runs a task: a host that destroyed the plug-in then got back at once
//! and could unload its library under that thread and the voices' workers (on Windows, a
//! crash). The helper is the plug-in's own: dropped, the plug-in stops it (a mend in progress
//! stopping before its next voice) and joins it, then stops and joins its voices' workers, so
//! no thread of the plug-in's runs once the host's destroy returns.
