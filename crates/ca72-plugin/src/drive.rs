//! DRIVE's AUTO GAIN (decisions.md R-STEREO, the CA-74's R29): the output brought back down by
//! as much as DRIVE made the sound louder, measured for the sound itself. Off the audio thread,
//! the plug-in's helper plays a few short notes through voices made as the engine's first are,
//! with the sound's panel, without DRIVE and at each of its steps, and compares their loudness
//! (K-weighted, as BS.1770 weighs it): the correction at each step, a curve. The curve is saved
//! with the session, so that the session plays and renders the same again; it is measured again
//! only when the sound is changed in the plug-in's own window (a preset chosen there among the
//! changes), never by the host's automation or a learned controller, so that a render does not
//! depend on when a measurement finished. Until a sound has been measured, the factory
//! presets' average stands in ([`AVERAGE`]). The audio thread only reads the curve, without a
//! lock.
//!
//! The machinery is plugin-kit's (`plugin_kit_stereo::auto_gain`, its K6); what is the
//! instrument's is here: the steps, the notes played, the average, a sound's key, and the
//! voices that measure it ([`Probe`]).
