//! DRIVE's AUTO GAIN (decisions.md R45, the CA-74's R29): the output brought back down by
//! as much as DRIVE made the sound louder, measured for the sound itself. Off the audio thread,
//! the plug-in's helper plays a few short notes through voices made as the engine's first are,
//! with the sound's panel, without DRIVE and at each of its steps, and compares their loudness
//! (K-weighted, as BS.1770 weighs it): the correction at each step, a curve. The curve is saved
//! with the session and with a preset (the factory's carry theirs), so that either plays and
//! renders the same again. It is measured again only when DRIVE or AUTO GAIN is changed in the
//! plug-in's own window, never by another control, a preset, the window opening, the host's
//! automation or a learned controller (decisions.md R-AUTO-GAIN-DRIVE): a curve that arrives
//! while a note plays moves its level, so one is measured only once the player has turned
//! DRIVE, and glides in.
//! Until a sound has been measured, the factory presets' average stands in ([`AVERAGE`]). The
//! audio thread only reads the curve, without a lock.
//!
//! The machinery is plugin-kit's (`plugin_kit_stereo::auto_gain`, its K6); what is the
//! instrument's is here: the steps, the notes played, the average, a sound's key, and the
//! voices that measure it ([`Probe`]).
