//! The plug-in's audio engine, apart from any plug-in format: the circuit model's voice in its
//! real-time (Potato) quality, played by MIDI notes, pitch bend and the modulation wheel, with
//! the side chain at EXTERNAL INPUT. Once the voices are built nothing here allocates
//! (`tests/realtime.rs`).
//!
//! POLY off, the one instrument takes every key through its keyboard circuit (lowest-note
//! priority, single triggering), as before. UNISON (outranking POLY) plays VOICES whole
//! instruments together, each taking every key through its own keyboard circuit as the one
//! does, each its own parts under ENTROPY and its own place under SPREAD, turned down by the
//! square root of VOICES (decisions.md R-STEREO, the CA-74's R25). POLY on, one voice per note, up to VOICES (2 to
//! 10) of the ten built: each the whole instrument with its own keyboard circuit, which its
//! note reaches as one key (`PolyKey`; decisions.md, "POLY"). A POLY note takes the voice
//! that last played its key if that voice is free or letting go, else the free voice whose
//! last note began longest ago, else the one let go longest ago, else the one held longest
//! (the CA-74's R27; decisions.md R-STEREO), so a chord struck again stays where it was and a
//! melody goes round the voices. ENTROPY makes each voice its own parts, SPREAD puts the voices
//! across the stereo field where the placement has them (`character.rs`), one voice alone in
//! the centre; both 0 by default, the circuit as drawn.
