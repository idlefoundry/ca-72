# Agents: the CA-72 through MCP

Issue [#76](https://github.com/idlefoundry/ca-72/issues/76); decisions.md R-MCP. Written
2026-10-18 for 0.3.0. An AI agent operates the CA-72 the way a player does, through the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io): it reads every control, turns them,
chooses, saves and organises presets, changes the settings and the view, uses MIDI Learn and
plays notes. Reference-sound matching (#77) uses the offline tools and workflow below. An agent skill
for skins (#78) is separate.

**Status.** The first version controls the **standalone application**. Plug-ins in a host
come later (see [Next: plug-ins in a host](#next-plug-ins-in-a-host)). It is built and tested
on Linux. macOS should work unchanged (Unix sockets), but it has not been tried. Windows needs
a named pipe and is not built yet. Several choices below are the owner's to confirm; they are
marked **owner's call**.

## Using it

1. In the CA-72 application, open SETTINGS (the gear on the rail) and choose
   **AGENTS › ALLOW**. Or start it with `ca72-standalone --agents`, which allows agents for that
   session only.
2. Tell the agent's MCP client to start the bridge, `ca72-mcp`, over standard input and output.
   In Claude Code, for example:

   ```sh
   claude mcp add ca-72 -- /path/to/ca72-mcp
   ```

   In a client configured with JSON, the entry is
   `{"command": "/path/to/ca72-mcp", "args": []}`.
3. Ask the agent to start with `ca72_describe`.

`ca72-mcp --instance ID` acts on one CA-72 when several are open; otherwise the agent chooses
with `ca72_select`. Building from source: `cargo build --release -p ca72-plugin --bin ca72-mcp`
(the bridge) and `scripts/standalone.sh` (the application). The 0.3 build and installer scripts ship `ca72-mcp` with the application. On macOS it is
`/Applications/CA-72.app/Contents/MacOS/ca72-mcp`; on Linux it is beside
`ca72-standalone` (normally `~/.local/bin`); on Windows it is `ca72-mcp.exe` beside `CA-72.exe`.

## Design

### Transport: a bridge, and a socket in the application

An MCP client normally starts its server as a child process and talks to it over stdio. The
CA-72 is a window the player opens, so it cannot be that child. Instead it is split in two:

```
agent's MCP client ──stdio, MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0, a message a line)──▶ ca72-mcp (the bridge)
                                                                        │
             Unix socket in the user's own runtime folder, JSON-RPC 2.0 a line
                                                                        ▼
            CA-72 standalone: the socket's threads ──inbox──▶ the editor's window thread
```

- **The bridge** (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/agent/bridge.rs`, binary `ca72-mcp`) speaks MCP on
  stdio (`agent/mcp.rs`), with the protocol revisions 2025-11-25, 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26 and
  2024-11-05. It offers the tools (`agent/tools.rs`). It finds the CA-72s that are open
  (`agent/discovery.rs`) and passes each tool's call to the chosen one as a JSON-RPC request.
  The MCP layer copies the shape of the owner's DAW's server (DAW-v3,
  `crates/daw-api/src/mcp.rs`, DESIGN 7.6): `initialize` agreeing a revision, `tools/list`
  with schemas, and a failed `tools/call` answered as a result with `isError` rather than a
  JSON-RPC error, so that the agent reads why. As in DAW-v3, one table generates the tools'
  schemas from the API's methods (D165, item 1). The parameters' schema is generated from the
  parameters themselves (`agent/values.rs`), so it cannot fall out of step with them. As in
  DAW-v3's `daw rpc` relaying to a running `daw serve`, the bridge is a client of a
  long-running process.
- **The application** (`agent/server.rs`) listens on a Unix socket while agents are allowed.
  Each connection has a thread that reads requests, a line at a time. `hello` and `ping` are
  answered there. Every other request goes into an inbox, and the editor takes from the inbox
  at each frame (`PanelWindow::on_frame` → `Editing::serve_agents`, `editor/agent.rs`). The
  editor carries each request out on its own thread and answers it.
- Why not let the client launch the application? A client that starts the standalone itself
  would own its lifetime, which breaks the case of a player already working in the window. It
  would also need a second, headless mode of the application. The socket serves both cases.
  The bridge could later gain a `--launch` option that starts the application with
  `--agents` when none is open; this is not built.

### Access: off unless the player allows it (owner's call)

- **Off by default.** Until the player chooses SETTINGS › AGENTS › ALLOW (kept in this
  computer's `settings.toml` as `agents = true`) or starts the application with `--agents`,
  no socket exists, so nothing can connect.
- **Local and the user's alone.** Only a Unix socket is used, never a network port. It lives
  in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ca-72/` (on macOS, the user's own temporary folder), and that folder is
  made readable by its user alone (mode 700, the socket 600). So only the user's own programs
  can reach it. `CA72_AGENT_DIR` moves it, which the tests use.
- **An agent can turn agents off but not on.** `ca72_settings_set {"agents": false}` closes
  the socket after answering. Turning agents on again is the player's job.
- **Everything is visible.** Every change shows on the panel at once, as if the player had
  made it.
- Not done: a per-connection approval prompt, or a token the player copies to the client. The
  owner may want one of these. Recommendation: the setting plus the user-only socket is enough
  for a local, single-user instrument; add a prompt only if agents from other users' sessions
  become possible.

### Instances

- **Discovery.** Each listening CA-72 writes a record in the discovery folder,
  `<kind>-<pid>.json`, holding its id, pid, kind (`standalone`), version, protocol and socket
  path. The record is written whole (written aside, then renamed) and removed when the CA-72
  stops listening. The bridge lists the records and drops any whose socket no longer answers,
  so a crashed instance leaves nothing behind for long.
- **Selection.** Calls go to the only CA-72 that is open. With several open and none chosen, a
  call is refused (`AMBIGUOUS`) with their ids. `ca72_instances` lists them; `ca72_select` or
  `--instance` chooses one.
- **Plug-ins.** These are designed in, not built. A plug-in instance would write the same kind
  of record with `kind` `clap`, `vst3` or `au`, plus its host's name and pid, and its track or
  instance name if the host gives one. `ca72_instances` would then list every CA-72 on the
  computer, in the application and in hosts, and the agent would choose among them as it does
  now.

### Consistency: the editor's own paths, never the audio thread

Each request is carried out by the editor, on its window's thread, through the same code its
controls use:

| What | The path taken (`editor/agent.rs`) |
|---|---|
| A parameter set | `Agentic::set_once`: `ParamSetter` begin, set, end through the host's `GuiContext`, a gesture of its own, as a click or typed value sets it. In the standalone, `Session::set_parameter` sets the atomic and the audio thread updates its smoother. |
| DETUNE, VOICES | Refused where the panel won't turn them (`operable`/`voices_inert`'s rules), with the reason. |
| MODE | The strip's tabs' rule: MONO turns POLY and UNISON off, POLY turns POLY on and UNISON off, UNISON leaves POLY as it is. |
| A preset loaded, stepped | `Browser::choose` and `Browser::step`, as the drawer and the rail's arrows do. |
| Saved, renamed | `Browser::save_sound` and `Browser::rename_preset`, which SAVE AS and RENAME now share with the agent. |
| Tagged, starred, deleted, reverted, restored | The drawer's `Library` calls, followed by `Browser::reread`. The drawer's hint line says what was done, as it does for the player. |
| A setting | `set_look`, `set_lettering`, `set_frequency_dials`, `keep_settings`, and the SIZE menu's `gripped` width, which the host is asked for at the next frame. |
| The view | The rail's PANEL and GLOBAL / KEYS / LFO keys (`toggle_panel`, `strip_press`), the drawer's `Browser::show`, the keyboard's octave keys, and the drawer's MIDI list. |
| A note | `Playing::agent`: owned like the pointer's and the typed keys', through `LocalNotes`, the lock-free queue the on-screen keyboard already uses. The audio thread takes them at its next block. |
| PANIC | The keyboard's PANIC (`Editing::panic`): `AppHandle::panic_tagged` in the standalone. |
| MIDI Learn | `Learning::learn`, `cancel` and `remove`; `MidiMap::assign` for an assignment given outright. |

After any change, the editor's `touched` flag asks for AUTO GAIN's curve once nothing is held,
as it does after the player's edits.

The parameters' only route to the audio thread is the atomics the editor already sets. Notes
go through the queue the on-screen keyboard uses. The socket's threads never touch the plug-in
except through the inbox (a mutex the editor holds only to take one request). The editor takes
at most 32 requests a frame. Nothing on the audio thread waits on any of it.

### Errors

A failed call is a tool result with `isError: true`. Its structured content has `error` (the
reason, written for the agent), `code`, and `details` that help put it right: the parameter's
range and choices, the similar preset names, the list of instances. Codes
(`crate::agent::codes`):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| -32602 | Invalid arguments: an unknown parameter or preset, a value out of range or not one of the choices, a malformed note. Nothing in the call is set. |
| -32004 | Refused as the panel would refuse it: DETUNE in SCATTER, a name already taken without `replace`, a control MIDI Learn never takes, a reserved CC. |
| -32003 | No CA-72 to talk to: none allows agents, the chosen one has closed, or the connection was lost. |
| -32005 | Several are open and none is chosen. |
| -32001 | The window didn't take the request within 10 s. Nothing was done. |
| -32002 | Busy: eight agents are connected, or AUTO GAIN is still measuring when a snapshot is requested. |

An unknown tool, or arguments that aren't an object, are JSON-RPC errors, as MCP specifies.

### Connection lifetime and disconnects

- The bridge connects at the first call that needs a CA-72 and keeps the connection.
- If the application quits, the next call is refused (`NO_INSTANCE`). If none was chosen and
  another CA-72 is open by then, for instance after a restart, the bridge connects to that one
  and the call goes through. So an agent's session outlives a restart.
- A request whose client goes away before the window has taken it is dropped, not carried out.
  The connection thread notices the close while it waits. A request the window has already
  taken is carried out, and its answer is discarded.
- A request the window doesn't take within 10 s is answered as timed out and never carried out
  afterwards. A request can be in one of three states (waiting, taken, dropped), and whichever
  side changes it first wins, so a request is never both refused and done.
- When agents are turned off, or the window closes, the inbox is closed. Waiting requests are
  answered at once, the threads end within 200 ms, and the socket and its record are removed.
- Each connection's requests are answered in order, one at a time. A line is at most 1 MiB.

### The wire between bridge and application

JSON-RPC 2.0, one object a line, over the socket. The methods are the tools' `method`s
(`describe`, `parameters.set`, ...), plus:

- `hello {name}`: names the client and answers `{name, id, kind, version, protocol, pid}`.
- `ping`.

The protocol number is 1. The bridge refuses an instance that speaks another, and tells the
agent to use the bridge that came with that instance.

### Values in `ca72_set`

A parameter is named by its id (as sessions and presets save it), its panel label, or its host
name, in any case. Values are in the units the panel prints:

- Knobs take their dial's numbers.
- FREQUENCY takes semitones from the centre, or a string such as `"+12 cents"`.
- ENTROPY, WIDTH and INNER take %, DETUNE takes cents, and DRIVE and LEVEL take dB.
- A string with its unit is accepted too (`"6 dB"`, `"50 %"`).
- A selector takes its position's name (`"16'"`, `"Sawtooth"`, `"Shark Tooth"`), its id
  (`"16"`, `"shark_tooth"`) or its index from 0.
- A switch takes `true`/`false` or `"on"`/`"off"`.

Every value is checked before anything is set. A value outside the control's range is refused,
not clamped (the error gives the range), and nothing in that call is set. The answer gives the
values as now set, which changed, MODE, and the preset's changed mark.

## Inventory: every user-facing control and its MCP equivalent

Sources: `ca72-panel` (`controls.rs`, `strip.rs`, `presets.rs`, `presets/drawer.rs`,
`keyboard.rs`, `learn.rs`, `ultra.rs`), and `ca72-plugin` (`params.rs`, `editor.rs`,
`learning.rs`, `presets.rs`, `library.rs`, `settings.rs`, `standalone_settings.rs`,
`update.rs`). Each parameter is listed with its range in the units printed. The MCP column is
the parameter's id in `ca72_set`/`ca72_get`, unless it says otherwise.

### The LFO page (decisions.md R-LFO)

set with the `modulation` tools (saved with presets and sessions, not a host parameter).

| MONO | key | on/off (on) | `lfoN_mono` |
| UNI (POLARITY: R-LFO's corrections) | key | Bipolar, Unipolar (Bipolar) | `lfoN_polarity` |
| WAVEFORM's menu: REVERSE | menu | on/off (off) | `lfoN_reverse` |
| ON (the key at its title: muted while off) | key | on/off (on) | `lfoN_on` |
| LEVEL (the OUT jack's: the wheel over it, typed there; R-LFO's addendum) | the jack | 0 to 100 % (100): the share of every assignment of the LFO's it gives | `lfoN_level` |
| EDGES (the LFO's menu) | menu | SOFT, SHARP (SOFT) | `ca72_modulation_set {source, edges}` |
| OUT jack: a drag to a knob | | a knob and a depth, -100 to 100 % (25) | `ca72_modulation_set {source, target, depth}` |
| A knob's menu: DEPTH…, REMOVE | | | `ca72_modulation_set`, `ca72_modulation_remove` |
| MODULATES | screen | | `ca72_modulations` (each LFO's `polarity`, `reverse` and `on` too) |

The LFOs' own knobs are targets too (R-LFO's addendum): any LFO (itself included) or macro on an
LFO's RATE (`lfoN_rate`, not while it is timed), PHASE (`lfoN_phase`), RISE (`lfoN_rise`),
WAVEFORM while CONTINUOUS (`lfoN_waveform`, its shape) and LEVEL (`lfoN_level`, "LFO 2 LEVEL";
the strip's LEVEL is `level`), by `ca72_modulation_set {source, target, depth}` as any knob.
Loops are allowed: each LFO reads the others' values from the latest of its ticks, every 0.5 ms
of audio time.

In the standalone the TEMPO screen is a target as well (`tempo`, "TEMPO"; decisions.md R-LFO): a
depth a share of TEMPO's 30 to 300 BPM, the arpeggiator, the timed oscillators and LFOs and the
effects following the moving tempo. A plug-in follows its host's tempo: there `tempo` is not
among `ca72_modulations`' targets, `ca72_modulation_set` refuses it ("standalone only"), and one
a standalone's patch brought is kept, listed `inert`.

### The macros (decisions.md R-MACROS)

The six macros' knobs are parameters; their names and what they move are the patch's, set with
the `modulation` tools (saved with presets and sessions, not host parameters). Which the left
area shows, the wheels or the macros, is the computer's (the rail's MACRO key), not exposed.

| Control | Kind | Values (as printed) | MCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| MACRO 1 to MACRO 6 | knob, 0 to 10 | 0 to 100 % (0) | `macro1` to `macro6` |
| The name's screen: RENAME… | screen | up to 7 characters, capitals ("" for MACRO n) | `ca72_modulation_set {source, name}` |
| The jack: a drag to a knob | | a knob and a depth, -100 to 100 % (25), one way: depth × the macro's value | `ca72_modulation_set {source, target, depth}` |
| A knob's menu: DEPTH…, REMOVE; the macro's REMOVE ALL ASSIGNMENTS | | | `ca72_modulation_set`, `ca72_modulation_remove` |
| COLOR (the name's menu) | menu | the computer's, not exposed | |

### The rail, the presets' drawer and the update check

| Control | MCP |
|---|---|
| Star key | `ca72_preset_favorite` (for the current preset: its name from `ca72_describe`) |
| PREV / NEXT keys | `ca72_preset_step {by: -1 / 1}` |

| SAVE key, SAVE AS | `ca72_preset_save` |
| PANEL key | `ca72_view {panel}` |
| GLOBAL / KEYS / LFO keys | `ca72_view {lower_page: "global" / "keyboard" / "lfo"}` selects and shows the page; a selected key does nothing. `keyboard: true / false` remains readable as keyboard / global. The returned `lower_page` names the selected page even with PANEL off. |
| SETTINGS key: see Settings | |
| FIND: SEARCH, tag chips | `ca72_presets {search, tags}` |

| A row's star | `ca72_preset_favorite` |
| RENAME, TAGS, DELETE (asks first), REVERT, RESTORE | `ca72_preset_rename`, `_tags`, `_delete` (no second press: the tool is marked destructive for the client to confirm), `_revert`, `ca72_presets_restore` |
| MIDI LEARN (the drawer's list) | `ca72_view {midi_list}`; `ca72_midi_assignments` |
| CLOSE | `ca72_view {presets: false}` |
| The status line, the hint | `ca72_describe` (the preset); every preset tool's answer |
| CHECK FOR UPDATES | `ca72_version {check: true}`. DOWNLOAD and RELEASES PAGE open the browser, which an agent cannot do. |
| Init preset | There is none in this version. A future Init (R-INIT, another branch) will be a preset like any other, loaded with `ca72_preset_load`. |

### Settings

### The on-screen keyboard and MIDI Learn

| Control | MCP |
|---|---|
| Keys (44, F2 to C6 by default) | `ca72_note_on`, `ca72_note_off`, `ca72_play`. Any note 0 to 127, not only the 44 shown. |

The arrow keys are the player's keyboard, as TYPING is: `ca72_preset_step` does the same. |

### Left out, and why

- **Visual only.** Hover, tooltips, animation (QUALITY's shutter, the hamster, the lamps),
  dimming, caret and focus, and decoration (the PHONES jack, the name plate). These change no
  state.
- **Indicators.** OVERLOAD, the voices' display, and AUTO GAIN's readout are left out. Their
  values move with the audio. `ca72_describe` gives the voices sounding and the keys held.
  OVERLOAD and the levels could be added for #77 if wanted.
- **Gestures.** A drag, the mouse wheel and Shift's fine control are ways to reach a value;
  `ca72_set` reaches it directly. A double click is `ca72_reset`.
- **ULTRA's note.** It is shown once and closed by a press; it's the player's to read.
- **TYPING.** Covered by `ca72_note_on` (see above).
- **Opening the browser** (DOWNLOAD, RELEASES PAGE). An agent can read whether there is an
  update, but it can't download one.
- **AUDIO & MIDI changes** (device, rate, buffer, MIDI inputs and channel). Not offered in this
  version. They go through `AppHandle::apply_tracked` after `negotiate`, as the dialog does,
  and can stop the sound. Recommendation: offer them in 0.3.0's second step, after a
  confirmation design. **Owner's call.**
- **Hosted effects and live controller state** are not part of offline rendering. The tools
  below render a detached dry synth and state those conditions in every manifest.

## Next: plug-ins in a host

What is needed, in order:

1. **A server without the editor.** In a host the editor is often closed, so requests can't
   wait for its frames. The parameter paths would move to the plug-in, keeping the editor's
   when it is open:
   - parameters through the host's context: CLAP's output events and VST3's
     `outputParameterChanges`, in the next process call, as MIDI Learn's
     `ProcessContext::set_parameter_normalized` does (nih-plug patch 10). This touches the
     audio thread, through a bounded lock-free queue only; or through the GUI context while the
     editor is open.
   - presets through `Library` and `presets::targets`.
   - notes through `LocalNotes`.

   Whatever the editor alone does would be refused while it is closed: the view, the look,
   window size, and MIDI Learn's waiting.
2. **Instance identity.** The record gets the format, the host's name and pid, and a name the
   player recognises: the host's track name where CLAP's `track-info` or VST3's
   `IInfoListener` gives it, otherwise the preset's name and an index.
3. **Many instances in one process.** Several plug-ins share a process, so one socket per
   instance is fine, but the discovery folder will have many records. `ca72_instances` should
   show the host and track names so the agent can choose.
4. **Access in a host.** The same setting applies. A host's sandbox may refuse the runtime
   folder: Logic's AU runs in its own process (AUHostingService), and Bitwig's plug-in host is
   separate too. This needs testing in each host.
5. **Windows.** A named pipe in place of the Unix socket, or AF_UNIX, which Windows 10 and 11
   support but Rust's standard library does not.
6. **Shipping the bridge.** Added for 0.3 in `scripts/standalone.sh` and the installers.
7. **For #77.** Implemented in the bridge: `ca72_snapshot`, `ca72_render`, `ca72_analyze`
   and `ca72_compare`, described below. Rendering never waits on a window or live audio thread.

## Offline reference matching (#77)

The bridge offers `ca72_render`, `ca72_analyze`, `ca72_compare` and `ca72_preset_export` without a device or a
running application. `ca72_snapshot` captures the selected live instance, including unsaved
edits. The MCP prompt `ca72_match_reference` (`prompts/get`, `arguments.reference`) supplies
[the fitting skill](agent-skills/ca72-match-reference/SKILL.md) to any client which supports
prompts; the same file can be installed as an agent skill. It is included in the bridge.

| Tool | Input | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `ca72_snapshot` | None; chosen live instance | Every normalized parameter, assignments and macro names, AUTO GAIN curve, seed, tempo, frequency-dial law and engine fingerprint |
| `ca72_render` | One of `init:true`, `snapshot`, `snapshot_file`, library `preset` or exact `preset_file`, else current sound; `notes [{note, start, duration}]`; `seconds` including tail (default 3); `sample_rate` (default 48000); optional `values`, `modulations`, `seed`, `tempo`, `frequency_dials`; required `effects: "dry"`, new absolute `output_dir` | `render.wav` (stereo float), `manifest.json`, complete candidate snapshot and SHA-256 hashes, including routing edits and the exact preset file source when used |
| `ca72_preset_export` | Candidate `snapshot` or exact `snapshot_file`, `name`, optional `tags`, new absolute `output_dir` | Normal user-preset TOML, its exact path/hash and manifest with `render_conditions`; does not install into the player's library |
| `ca72_analyze` | Absolute WAV `path`, optional `start`, `seconds`, `fundamental_hz`, `modulation_hz`, named `regions`; new `output_dir` | Pitch, loudness, onsets, 10 ms envelope, harmonics and optional sidebands; full `metrics.json` and a labelled spectrogram PNG, also returned inline |
| `ca72_compare` | Absolute `reference` and `candidate` WAV paths, optional `reference_start`, `candidate_start`, `seconds`, harmonic/sideband arguments, named `regions`, optional `approved` and `preservation_limits`; new `output_dir` | Gain correction, spectral errors at 512/2048/8192 samples, envelope and pitch differences, full metrics, spectrograms on the same scale and two level-matched A/B WAVs |

`ca72_experiment` adds bounded candidate sweeps with cached reference regions, optional
approved-expression preservation and a common-level HTML audition report. It accepts the
render inputs plus `reference`, `regions`, up to eight independent `{id,values?,modulations?}`
candidates, optional `approved` and explicit `preservation_limits`. Every candidate validates
before output; limits are 120 rendered seconds and 12 million frames per batch. Exact snapshot
files support continuation/export without large JSON state copies. No automatic winner is
selected. See [experiment inputs, measurements and limits](mcp-experiments.md).

`start`, `duration` and `seconds` are seconds; `note` is MIDI 0 to 127 (C4 = 60). Gates are
rounded to samples and must span at least one. A repeated note cannot overlap itself. Each
render is 1024 samples to 60 s, at 8 to 192 kHz. The reference parser accepts complete mono
or stereo PCM/float WAV files up to 128 MiB and crops of 1024 samples to 60 s. It refuses
invalid formats, truncated chunks, partial frames, non-finite audio, or a crop past the end.
Comparison refuses rate/length differences and silence, with no hidden truncation, resampling,
time alignment or pitch shift. Sources are read only; existing output directories are refused.
A render's `manifest.json`, or measurement's `metrics.json`, is written last as its completion
marker. An interrupted/failed run may leave an incomplete directory; use a new one to retry.

### Render fidelity and repeatability

A short editor request captures state; the bridge does all rendering and file I/O afterwards.
The renderer owns a fresh `Ca72` and calls the same `Ca72::process` as normal playback, using
its current parameter conversion, clock, arpeggiator, LFOs, macros, stereo, DRIVE, LEVEL and
AUTO GAIN. It sets up voices and smoothers without loading computer preferences or starting
real-time workers, a device or the live helper. It uses the framework's scoped floating point
flush-to-zero setting and no audio deadlines. Non-finite samples, voice recovery or output
sanitisation refuse the render. AUTO GAIN fields are typed and bounded before rendering.

Snapshot overrides retain the captured AUTO GAIN curve. Named/file presets select the curve
for the requested quality (LO or HI/ULTRA) before rendering, as loading into a live instance does.
To recalibrate it after changing DRIVE
or AUTO GAIN, use the live controls, release notes, then capture again; `ca72_snapshot` returns
BUSY while measurement is pending. Verify the settled curve before saving.

**Secondary envelopes and routing without an app.** All four LFOs' controls are already
parameters in `values` (`lfoN_mode`, `rate`, `phase`, `rise`, `waveform`, `polarity`,
`reverse`, `mono`, `level`). `Env` runs one cycle and holds its final value; the rate
sets the duration, or a timed division follows tempo. `modulations` adds or changes routing
with the same `source`, `target`, `depth`, `edges` and macro `name` rules as
`ca72_modulation_set`. Edits apply in order **after** `values`, so enable CONTINUOUS or
untimed mode before assigning a conditional target. Existing assignments remain unless
edited. `{"source":"lfo1","target":"cutoff","remove":true}` removes one;
omitting `target` removes every assignment of that source. A remove edit takes only source
and optional target. There are at most 128 edits; invalid fields, unavailable targets or a
rejected edit reject the whole batch before output is created. Effect pins are unavailable.
The manifest records the edits and the snapshot carries the resulting routing.

For example, a per-voice triangular amplitude envelope on oscillator 1, independent of
the standard loudness contour:

```json
{
  "preset": "White Lotus", "effects": "dry",
  "values": {
    "poly": true, "osc1_volume": 0, "osc2_on": false, "osc3_on": false,
    "noise_on": false, "loudness_attack": 0, "loudness_sustain": 10,
    "lfo1_mode": "Env", "lfo1_waveform": "Triangle", "lfo1_rate": 0.8,
    "lfo1_phase": 0, "lfo1_rise": 0, "lfo1_polarity": "Unipolar",
    "lfo1_mono": false
  },
  "modulations": [{"source":"lfo1", "target":"osc1_volume", "depth":100}],
  "notes": [{"note":60,"start":0.1,"duration":1.5},
            {"note":64,"start":0.5,"duration":1.3}],
  "seconds": 2, "output_dir": "/absolute/existing-parent/env-candidate"
}
```

MONO off gives each voice its own copy for per-voice targets such as oscillator mixer
volumes and cutoff. Main `volume` and strip `level` are shared targets even with MONO off.
For a breath envelope, route the relevant oscillator/noise volumes and filter, rather than
assuming main VOLUME is per voice. Each LFO's `Retrig` mode restarts phase and RISE on every
note-on, independently of the main `retrigger` switch. This permits note-reset vibrato with
legato loudness/filter contours. Shared ENV and FREE's RISE retain the main switch's phrase
triggering; newly allocated polyphonic voices start their own generators, as in playback.
Saved presets retain the routing and LFO parameters; export and reload the file to verify it.

The snapshot carries the frequency-dial law because it affects frequency modulation, though
it normally lives in computer settings. Named-preset rendering uses 120 BPM and semitone
frequency dials; capture the loaded live preset when its computer preferences should apply.
An explicit `tempo` override follows the standalone screen's whole-BPM rounding. Candidate
`values` are in the panel units of `ca72_set`, through its same parser, and affect only the
offline copy. The result returns the fully overridden snapshot for the next iteration.

Seeded noise, component variation and arpeggiator randomness repeat. Snapshots carry an
engine source SHA-256 and refuse replay in a bridge built from different sources, even when
both say 0.3.0. Manifests record version, source and snapshot hashes, rate, exact gates,
quality, tempo, seed, block size and WAV hash. This does not promise identical floating point
results between different targets or compilers. The output compensates the engine's reported
latency by rendering extra samples and removing that initial delay; the removed count is kept.

Every render explicitly requests dry output. Hosted effects and external audio are excluded
(the external jack receives silence); output gain and synth feedback remain part of the synth.
Computer MIDI preset-action bindings are excluded, so a scheduled note cannot be consumed by
the player's NEXT/PREVIOUS PRESET shortcut. Oscillators, LFO runtime phase and MIDI controllers start fresh. This is a settings snapshot,
not a capture of already sounding notes, pedals, pressure, wheel offsets or an effect's tail.

### Interpreting a comparison

LUFS matching uses a common stereo layout (mono duplicated to two speakers); very short clips
fall back to RMS. Both spectral and envelope differences count extra candidate harmonics,
noise and release tails as well as missing reference material. Spectrograms use 4096-sample
Hann frames, a logarithmic frequency axis and an 80 dB colour range. The full JSON records
the axes, bin resolution and envelope trace. A/B files have the same common attenuation when
needed to keep their peaks below 0.9, after candidate level matching.

Pitch tracking assumes one predominant part. Use individual held-note crops and known
`fundamental_hz` for harmonics; `modulation_hz` measures sidebands relative to each harmonic.
A sideband closer than three analysis bins is unresolved (`null`). Reference harmonics in a
full mix include other instruments. These metrics guide fitting; none is an automatic pass,
a perceptual similarity percentage or proof of an exact match. Listen to the A/B pair.
Whole-mix LUFS and spectral error include other parts: do not use them as a bass-only fitting
objective. For listening, establish gain on the clearest bass note or provide an explicitly
labelled, identically filtered aid, alongside the original unprocessed recording.

Without the app, export the selected snapshot with `ca72_preset_export`, then pass the returned
`preset_file` and `render_conditions` to `ca72_render` with the same notes, rate and duration.
The file is parsed directly with the browser's preset parser (at most 1 MiB), without resolving
factory overlays or another file of the same name. Conditions include the quality, pitch wheel,
bypass, MIDI bend range, seed, tempo and frequency law which a preset excludes.
For live installation, apply the selected candidate through the live controls, save with
`ca72_preset_save`, load it again, then re-render. Presets round values to four decimal
places and exclude the player's quality, seed, tempo and dial preference. Keep those render
conditions fixed and report material save/reload differences. No automatic transcription,
source separation or parameter optimiser is claimed.

The [2026-10-21 original-recording validation](mcp-recording-validation.md) records a full
52-second fit from the actual White Lotus source excerpt, independent validation notes,
preset export/reload, measured residuals and its remaining listening/coverage limits.

## Tests

- `cargo test -p ca72-plugin --lib agent` covers the following:
  - **The dispatcher and schemas** (`agent::mcp`, `agent::tools`): the handshake and revision,
    the tool list, calls and their failures, unknown tools and methods, bad JSON, batches
    refused, an over-long line; every tool's schema well formed; `ca72_set`'s schema naming
    every parameter.
  - **The values** (`agent::values`): every host parameter in the table once; the panel's
    units; parsing and range checks.
  - **Discovery**: records, the dead ones removed, the folder made private.
  - **The server**: hello, ping and methods answered in order; unknown methods; bad JSON;
    socket permissions; a request not taken is dropped; a client gone mid-request; at most
    eight clients; stopping answers what waits.
  - **The bridge**: none open, one, two, choosing, the chosen one closing, reconnecting to
    another after the first one stops.
- **Through the bridge to a real editor** (`editor::agent::tests`): an editor (the window's
  `Editing`, with a host that applies its changes as the standalone's does) behind a real socket,
  driven by `ca72-mcp`'s code in MCP's text through pipes. These tests cover parameters,
  presets, notes, settings, the view, MIDI Learn, agents turned off, and a client gone
  mid-request.
- **End to end**: the real `ca72-standalone --no-devices --agents` on Linux, driven through
  the built `ca72-mcp` by a JSON-RPC script, and by a real MCP client (decisions.md R-MCP has
  what was run).
