# The release's decisions

How the circuit model became the CA-72 plug-in. The model's own decisions, made while it
was a device of the DAW it was developed in, are in [history.md](history.md). "The owner"
is the person who commissioned the work; an agent decision is one the owner has not
separately approved.

## R1. A plug-in of its own, the CA-72 by Idle Foundry
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-01.** The circuit-derived model is released as an open-source
plug-in, in this repository, separate from that DAW: the synth core, the SPICE runner, the
analysis, the lab, the netlists and the derivation documents are all here.

- **Nothing trademarked on the product or its interface.** The instrument it models is
  named only as a fact, in the documents (the README's notice). The plug-in is the CA-72;
  its maker, Idle Foundry.
- **The name plate turns over.** A click on it turns it about its long axis, in 0.65 s,
  to a second name, "Model DEEZ", and back. The plate is as wide as that name needs, and
  stays that width for both.
- **Only the real-time quality, Potato.** The model's No Compromises and High Fidelity
  qualities do not run in real time; they stay in the library and the lab, and the
  plug-in has no QUALITY control.

## R2. The panel: the controller in a column, the ticks as printed
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-01.** Of the agent's mock-ups the owner chose the one with the
left hand controller in a full-height column at the panel's left (GLIDE and DECAY at its
top, the wheels below). The ticks were measured again against a photograph, the knobs'
reflections made less pronounced, and the wood runs the whole width with no cheeks
(history.md has the measurements; the DAW's own panel was changed to match).

**Agent decision, 2026-10-01.** The plate is lettered in TeX Gyre Adventor, the panel's
face, 261 units wide. The approved mock-up drew it in Helvetica Bold, 270 wide, only
because its page named a bold font file that did not exist. Not separately approved.

## R3. The rear panel: the side chain, MIDI bend, no CV
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-01.** EXTERNAL INPUT is the host's side chain. The rear
panel's control voltage and trigger jacks are left out. How far a MIDI keyboard's bend
moves the pitch is a parameter, MIDI BEND RANGE (2 semitones by default).

**Agent decision, 2026-10-01.** PHONES and the column's jacks are drawn, as the
instrument has them, but do nothing: the plug-in's output is its only output.

## R4. VST3 and CLAP, GPL-3.0-or-later
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-01.** The formats are VST3 and CLAP, and the licence is the GNU
General Public License, version 3 or later. macOS signing and notarisation wait: the owner
has a Developer ID, and the builds are unsigned until it is set up.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-01.** The plug-in is built with nih-plug, vendored with two
fixes that clap-validator needs (`third_party/nih-plug/PATCHES.md`). The output is mono,
the same on every output channel, in a stereo or a mono layout. POWER is the host's
bypass: the output fades over 10 ms, and the voice rests once silent. A third fix to
nih-plug came from Steinberg's validator: its VST3 wrapper matched the host's bus
arrangements against the wrong buses, reading past the end of the host's array, and so
refused even the mono layout it offers.

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-01):** `scripts/validate.sh` on the release bundles:
clap-validator 0.4.1, 37 tests passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness
10, SUCCESS, its editor tests among them; Steinberg's validator (SDK 3.8.1), 47 passed, 0
failed. That validator's bypass test prints two errors and still passes: nih-plug ignores
a value the host sets on the controller while the plug-in is processing, and takes it from
the next block's parameter changes instead. Hosts send both, so it is left as it is.

## R5. The editor, drawn natively
**Owner decision, 2026-10-01.** The editor is drawn in Rust, not in a web view.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-01.**
- The panel's art is SVG, written by `ca72-panel` and rendered with resvg. What never
  moves is rendered once for a size; each control, lamp and the plate is a layer of its
  own, rendered again only when it changes. The window is baseview's, its pixels shown
  with softbuffer.
- The editor reads the parameters each frame rather than waiting for the host's
  notifications, so automation, presets and undo all show the same way.
- The window resizes from a grip at its bottom right corner, in the panel's proportions,
  and the width is saved with the session. A host cannot resize it (nih-plug does not
  support that).
- **Fixed 2026-10-02** (the owner found that on the Mac a resize shrank the window while
  the panel kept its size, until the editor was opened again). baseview on macOS resizes
  its view when asked but reports no resize of its own making (only a change of scale), so
  the frames stayed at the old size. The editor now applies the new size itself when the
  grip resizes it; on Linux and Windows the report that follows finds it already taken.
  Test: the grip's, every frame at the new size.
- `crates/ca72-panel/tests/approved.png` is the approved mock-up, every control at half
  its travel. The panel as drawn must match it, the plate left out.

## R6. The editor opens at 80 % of the screen
**Owner decision, 2026-10-01.** The editor opened at 1720 logical pixels, the whole width
of a 16-inch MacBook Pro's screen; the owner asked for about 80 %.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-01.**
- Until the grip resizes it, the editor opens at 80 % of the screen's usable width (less
  the menu bar, dock or taskbar), its height also kept within 80 % of the usable height.
  The screen is macOS's main screen, Windows' primary monitor, or the X11 screen. Where
  the size is unknown, it opens at 1380 pixels.
- The saved width is 0 until the grip sets one, so a session opens to fit whichever
  screen it is on. A session saved before this change keeps the 1720 it stored.

## R7. POLY, the full MIDI range, ANALOG and SPREAD
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-01** (the request made for the DAW's instrument and for this
plug-in alike): POLY switches between the one instrument and one per note, 1 to 10 voices,
easily; every MIDI note plays, 41 to 84 exactly as before; ANALOG and SPREAD, each 0 to
100 % and 0 by default, ANALOG giving each voice its own tolerances on the oscillators'
tuning, the cutoff and EMPHASIS, the contours' times and GLIDE, with the oscillators' and
cutoff's drift; SPREAD placing POLY's voices by their number, the first in the centre; the
voice count never asking more of the machine without saying so. With them all off a
session sounds as before. Ported from the DAW, where each part was measured first.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-01** (not separately approved):

### POLY
- POLY is a parameter (a switch), VOICES another (2 to 10, 4 by default), both under the
  panel on the plug-in's own strip, not on the instrument's face. Ten voices are built when
  the plug-in is activated (off the audio thread: the first at a new rate takes up to a
  second, the rest are copies), so switching POLY or VOICES while playing allocates
  nothing; switching POLY lifts every key, and the notes sounding stop.
- Each voice is the whole instrument with its own keyboard circuit, which its note reaches
  as one key held while the note is. GLIDE slides from the last key that voice played.
- A new note takes a free voice (one let go whose output has stayed under 1e-6 for a whole
  block) by its number, else the one let go longest ago, else the one held longest.
- A note that takes a voice whose key was still down lifts the key and presses the new one
  once the voice's trigger contact has been open 13 ms: the modelled circuit re-arms its
  trigger only after about 12 ms (Q20 holds the reset line until C7 has drained), so its
  contours start again, as the instrument's S-trigger does. The note's pitch and attack
  come 13 ms after it. `crates/ca72/tests/retrigger.rs` finds the threshold between 11.5
  and 12 ms at 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz.
- The MIDI wheels and the panel reach every voice.
- POLY off is the plug-in as it was, to the sample (`tests/sound.rs`).
- A voice that has fallen silent is not run until its next note: it stops in time, and its
  contours resume from where they were (below the VCA's cutoff), not from rest. The same
  fuzz found that such a voice resumed with DECAY moved to its end could send the decay's
  Newton steps below the -10 V rail, and the follower's bracket check then panicked on the
  audio thread. Now a step that runs off below the rail is taken again from where the
  capacitor was, both nodes' steps held to 0.2 V, else the capacitor holds for that
  sample; every other step is as before. Test: `crates/ca72-plugin/tests/fuzz_bounds.rs`
  (every control at its ends, notes over all 128: a panic and NaN before, six seeds of 200
  rounds clean after).

### The full MIDI range
- Beyond the instrument's 44 keys, the circuit plays its end key (F or C) and the keys
  beyond are added at the keyboard's output, at the output's own volts a key, gliding with
  GLIDE while the trigger is closed: the plug-in's extension, not the circuit's. Moving the
  key string's foot in the circuit instead saturates the keyboard's amplifier (-2.86 and
  +6.92 V), so MIDI 0 to 7 and 122 to 127 each played one pitch.
- Every note's keyboard voltage is within 0.12 mV of the scale, and on 8' every note is
  within 5 cents (`crates/ca72/tests/midi_range.rs`). The oscillators' own limits, at the
  ends: on 2' the top notes run sharp (2.6 cents at MIDI 96, 8.4 kHz, to 53 at MIDI 127,
  50 kHz), on LO the lowest flat (3.7 to 10.5 cents at MIDI 0 to 36), as the circuit does
  there. Lowest-note priority covers all 128.
- A session made before this version may hold notes outside 41 to 84 that were silent;
  they now sound.
- **The converter's ceiling.** clap-validator's `param-fuzz-bounds` found that a key far
  beyond the 44 with an oscillator's RANGE at 2', FREQUENCY and the PITCH wheel at their
  tops (about 100 kHz) drove the exponential converter past where its model holds: above
  about 1e-2 A R42's feedback takes the tail node past any rail, the solve went to NaN and
  the voice stayed silent for good. The timing current is held at 5 mA
  (`vco::TIMING_MAX`, twice MIDI 127's at the panel's centre; up to it the solve converges),
  its Early slope as the converter gives it there. Below it nothing changes. Test:
  `crates/ca72/tests/midi_range.rs`, the case in every mode (NaN before, held after).

### ANALOG and SPREAD
- The DAW's character, the same draws and arithmetic
  (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/character.rs`): each voice's parts drawn once from its seed (the
  first voice's is the session's seed, as with one voice). At 100 % (twice the character's
  figures, `ANALOG_DEPTH`: the owner found them too subtle, 2026-10-02; 50 % is what 100 %
  was): each oscillator's tuning spread 8 cents (an offset at its range tap), the cutoff
  0.08 octave (at R51, 0.98 V an octave), EMPHASIS, the contours' ATTACK and DECAY and
  GLIDE 0.024 of their rotation; each oscillator drifts (a mean-reverting walk, 6 cents, 4
  s) and wavers (0.8 cent under 30 Hz), the cutoff drifts (0.03 octave). Sustains, levels
  and waveshapes are left alone.
- SPREAD places voice n at 0, -1, +1, -0.5, +0.5, -0.75, +0.75, -0.25, +0.25, -0.125 times
  the amount, a voice in the centre whole on both sides. The output became stereo for it;
  on a mono output it is the two channels together, so a session with SPREAD at 0 sounds
  as before on either.
- SPREAD is drawn at half opacity while POLY is off (the owner, 2026-10-02, approved
  greying it out for a patch of a single voice): the one voice is in the centre, so it does
  nothing. It stays operable (agent's decision), to be set before POLY goes on. The strip
  has no tips, so it is dimmed only. Test: `strip::tests::spread_dims_while_poly_is_off`.
  (A stereo spread of the three oscillators in one voice was weighed and dropped: they are
  summed before the one filter, so it would need a second mixer, filter and VCA.)

### POLY in real time
- **Since R11** (the owner's decision, 2026-10-02): POLY's voices are shared between the
  host's audio thread and up to four threads of the plug-in's own, and the strip's count
  measures the engine with them. What follows is how it stood before, with its figures.
- POLY's voices run in turn on the host's audio thread. The plug-in starts no threads of
  its own: the host sizes its own threads to the machine, and a plug-in's busy threads
  beside them would be more than the machine has.
- When it is activated, the plug-in measures a voice's cost in a block where its key
  changes, at the host's rate and largest block, and counts how many such fit in 60 % of
  the block's period (the DAW's figure). The strip shows that number beside VOICES and
  marks VOICES when it asks for more ("expect dropouts"). **Since R12** the strip shows no
  count and the plug-in measures none when activated.
- Measured (`tests/poly_bench.rs`: the engine as a host calls it, on one promoted thread,
  48 kHz, changing chords every half second with the modulation moving, ANALOG 50 %,
  SPREAD 70 %, 60 s, a block a period and never back to back; two clean runs a count):
  - **The Linux reference machine** (Ryzen 7 7800X3D), 256 frames: **4 voices** with no
    late block in two runs (mean 2.5 ms of 5.33, worst 4.7); 5 voices 1 late block in a
    minute, 6 voices 87, 8 voices 1,821, 10 every block. At 512 frames 8 voices were still
    late 842 times. The strip's own count there: 4 at 256 frames.
  - **The Mac** (M4 Pro): not measured cleanly. Ableton Live was running and playing there,
    and the block's time hardly changed from 3 to 6 voices, so the bench thread was held
    back rather than paying for the voices. The strip's own count there: 7 at 256 frames.
    To be measured again on a quiet Mac.
  - No run was demoted by the watchdog.
- **Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-02, the release bundles of this version):** clap-validator
  0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped (before the two fixes `param-fuzz-bounds` failed
  every time); pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS, its editor tests skipped this
  time (`--skip-gui-tests`: the Mac was in use, and they open windows on its screen);
  Steinberg's validator (SDK 3.8.1), 47 passed, 0 failed. The workspace's tests and clippy
  pass on the Mac and on Linux. Linux's validators were not run locally (the Linux
  reference machine has no cmake or xvfb-run); CI runs them.
- So VOICES defaults to 4, what the Linux reference machine plays at 256 frames; the strip
  shows each machine's own count (a voice costs about the same share of any block, so a
  larger block barely changes it: 4 at 1024 frames on that machine too).

## R8. FEEDBACK: the phones' VOLUME knob
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02.** The instrument has no overdrive control; players cable its
PHONES output into EXTERNAL INPUT and turn the phones' VOLUME up, overdriving the external
input's preamplifier and the mixer. The owner asked for a feedback control, and then for it
to take the place of the unused volume knob: the phones' VOLUME, which did nothing (R3), is
now FEEDBACK, its legend reading FEEDBACK. The same was done in the DAW's instrument.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):
- FEEDBACK (`feedback`, 0 to 10 on the knob's dial, 0 by default: no cable) sends each
  voice's output, before MAIN OUTPUT's VOLUME, into its EXTERNAL INPUT one sample later (a
  loop cannot be instantaneous), added to the side chain there. The level sent follows the
  knob's taper (the owner, 2026-10-02, found 3 on the dial already very intense; that
  should come at about 6): `feedback_law` = travel^2.357, so 6 sends 30 % of the output, 3
  about 6 %, 5 20 %, 10 all of it. The parameter (what automation sees) is the knob's
  position.
  As with the cable it is heard through the MIXER's EXTERNAL INPUT switch and VOLUME, and
  OVERLOAD lights.
- While FEEDBACK is on the preamplifier is solved as High Fidelity solves it: Potato's
  (its paths fitted to the circuit's gain) sent the loop into a low, dark oscillation the
  circuit does not make. With it Potato sounds as High Fidelity does at 30 % (level within
  1 %, brightness 30.5 % against 28.7 % above 1 kHz; `crates/ca72/tests/feedback.rs`).
  **Since R11** (the owner's decision, 2026-10-02): inside the loop Potato's preamplifier is
  its own model at twice the rate, its output as late as the circuit's
  (`preamp::Delayed`), within the circuit's own spread in the loop.
- Cost: a voice about 9.6 us a sample with FEEDBACK on, against 1.8 without (the Linux
  reference machine): about half a core at 48 kHz. The strip's real-time count is measured
  both ways at activation and shows the one in force: on that machine at 256 frames, 4 POLY
  voices without FEEDBACK, none with it. One voice (POLY off) with FEEDBACK costs about
  half the period. **Since R11:** FEEDBACK costs a voice about a fifth more.
- The approved panel (R2, `crates/ca72-panel/tests/approved.png`) differs only at that knob
  and its legend; the comparison still passes within its limits.
- The knob is dimmed while EXTERNAL INPUT is closed (the owner, 2026-10-02, approved: in a
  test the knob seemed to do nothing, as EXTERNAL INPUT was off, and the owner asked for it
  to be greyed out unless the external input is switched on and its volume above zero).
  While the mixer's EXTERNAL INPUT switch is off or its VOLUME is at 0 the knob is drawn at
  half opacity, as the parts with no parameter are, and its tip reads "FEEDBACK (silent:
  switch EXTERNAL INPUT on in the MIXER and turn its VOLUME up)". It stays operable
  (agent's decision), so the amount can be set first. The sound is unchanged. Tests:
  `controls::feedback_silent`'s cases and `render::tests` (the knob's pixels dimmed,
  nothing else on the panel changed).
- Tests: `crates/ca72/tests/feedback.rs` (not heard with EXTERNAL INPUT off; OVERLOAD lit and
  the sound brighter in every mode; Potato as High Fidelity; finite and within the rails
  with every control feeding the loop at its end), the threaded test (the same samples to
  the bit), the engine's bounds fuzz (`tests/fuzz_bounds.rs`, FEEDBACK at its ends too).

## R9. A floor of mismatch, and LOCK
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02** (with the DAW's instrument). With ANALOG at 0 the three
oscillators were identical: at one pitch they locked in phase and sounded up to 3.5 dB
louder than with ANALOG on, which invites judging by loudness. The owner chose a small
built-in mismatch, with a switch that makes the oscillators perfectly identical, turned
down to match so it cannot win by loudness, and a tooltip.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):
- With LOCK off each oscillator keeps a floor of its own (`ANALOG_FLOOR`, 0.75 of the
  character's figures: a tuning spread of 3 cents, 2.25 cents of drift, 0.3 cent of waver);
  ANALOG adds to it. In the DAW the level then moves 0.4 dB across ANALOG's range.
- LOCK (`lock`, off by default) makes the oscillators the circuit as drawn and turns the
  output down by `lock_trim`: the switched-on oscillators that share a pitch and their
  volumes give the ideal gain of locking, of which 0.68 shows at the output (`LOCK_SHARE`,
  fitted in the DAW). Measured: three in unison +0.4 dB with LOCK, one oscillator 0.0
  (`tests/sound.rs`); octaves lock only in part and are left, about 0.7 dB.
- The plug-in has no rear panel, so LOCK is a parameter without a control on the panel: a
  host shows it in its list of parameters ("Lock (oscillators identical)").
- A session saved before this version, with ANALOG at 0, now has the floor (the plug-in is
  not yet released; the DAW keeps its older devices exact).

## R10. Presets: a library shared with the DAW, a bar and a drawer
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02** (with the DAW's instrument). The owner asked for a few
factory presets, from well-regarded published patches under new names; for every preset to
be created, edited and deleted; and for favourites, search and tags. The plug-in gets the
same full browser as the DAW's (built there first); the two share one library; the presets
drop down from the bottom, in a drawer (agreed: a bar under the strip, a drawer sliding up
over the panel, not growing the window, which hosts may refuse).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):
- **A preset is named panel settings**: the dials' plain values by parameter ID (a choice
  by its index, a switch 0 or 1), POLY and VOICES too, never the PITCH wheel or the bypass;
  the MOD wheel is part of one. The plug-in's IDs and ranges are the DAW's instrument's,
  so one file serves both. Choosing one sets every other parameter to its default, POLY and
  VOICES only when it names them; each parameter changed is a gesture of its own. **Since
  R12** POLY, VOICES, ANALOG and SPREAD are set like the rest, and every factory preset
  names them.
- **The factory's 17** are `crates/ca72-plugin/sounds/minimoog.toml`, the DAW's file byte
  for byte (the DAW's record gives each one's source, their levelling and the adjustments
  made on the model). Built in, never changed.
- **The user's are files** in `<data>/Idle Foundry/CA-72/Presets` (`$IDLE_FOUNDRY_SHARED`
  overrides the `Idle Foundry` folder), `<name>.toml`: `format`, `name`, `description`,
  `tags`, `favorite`, `replaces`, `values`; written whole and moved into place. The factory
  presets' tags, favourites and deletions are the folder's `factory.toml`; saving over or
  renaming a factory preset writes the user's version standing in for it (REVERT takes it
  back); deleting one hides it (RESTORE FACTORY). Names: 1 to 64 characters, none of
  `/ \ : * ? " < > |`, unique ignoring case. The DAW reads and writes the same files the
  same way (checked both ways with each program's own writer: each lists the other's
  presets, tags and favourites, and sets the same normalized values).
- **The plug-in remembers its preset** (`preset`, a persisted field saved with the
  session); the bar marks it • once a parameter leaves the preset's value.
- **The window grows by the bar** (80 panel units): 617 pixels tall at 1720 wide, was 577.
  **Since R12** the bar is the strip's left, and the window is 577 again.
- **The drawer takes the keyboard** while open (baseview's focus on opening and on a
  field): typing goes to the field with the caret (the search when none), the arrows step
  through the list setting each preset, Enter commits, Escape takes back an edit or
  closes, Tab moves between the search and the save fields. Keys with Command or Control
  stay the host's, and with the drawer shut every key is.
- **Drawn** with the strip's colours and the panel's typeface; the star and the arrows are
  shapes (the typeface has no such glyphs).
- **Tests:** `library::tests` (saved, found, tagged, made favourite, renamed, removed; a
  factory preset edited, renamed, reverted, deleted, restored; a file of the DAW's read, an
  unreadable one reported), `ca72-panel` `presets::tests` (fields edit at the caret, every
  control found where drawn, the caret placed by a click, the frames drawn), and the
  editor's (the bar opens the drawer over the panel, a row sets the parameters and is
  remembered, typing searches, the arrows and the bar's step, a chip filters, the wheel
  scrolls the list, SAVE… saves with tags, RENAME and TAGS in place, DELETE after asking,
  RESTORE, the host's shortcuts left to it).
- Checked on the Mac, 2026-10-02: clap-validator, pluginval at strictness 10 (its GUI tests
  skipped while Live was open) and Steinberg's validator pass; in Live the drawer takes the
  keyboard and the search works (the owner).

**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02, later** (trying it in Live): the drawer opens downward,
extending the plug-in's window; the strip's "NOT THE INSTRUMENT'S" read oddly: it says
CA-72; a double click on a preset chooses it and closes the drawer.

**Agent decisions:**
- The drawer opens below the bar: the editor asks the host to resize (as the grip does),
  its size counting the drawer while it is open (`drawer_height`: 845 panel units, 423
  pixels at 1720 wide), and the window follows at once (baseview on macOS reports no
  resize of its own making: R5). It slides down from under the bar; it shuts at once, the
  window shrinking back. A host that will not resize keeps the window and the drawer
  slides up over the panel's lower part as before; the bar's arrow points where the
  drawer goes. Tests: the window's height with the drawer and without, a double click, a
  host refusing to resize.

## R11. Ten POLY voices in real time
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02.** Every preset should play ten POLY voices on the owner's
Mac without trouble, as a VST3 in Ableton Live; on Windows in Live, POLY had dropped out
constantly. The Mac (Apple M4 Pro) is the acceptance machine, Live's buffer there 256
samples: in Ableton Live 12 at 48 kHz, the VST3 with POLY on and VOICES at 10 plays each of
the 17 factory presets with ten-note chords (held, and changing every half second) for 60 s
with no dropout and no CPU overload, at 256 samples. Headless, each preset at ten voices
takes at most 60 % of the audio thread's period, worst block included. Shown both
measurements, the owner approved:
- **Worker threads of the plug-in's own, on by default**, reversing R7's "the plug-in starts
  no threads".
- **FEEDBACK's new preamplifier model** inside the loop (below): not the same samples as
  R8's, but within the circuit's own spread.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):

### Measuring
- `tests/preset_cost.rs` (the engine as a host calls it, as fast as it goes on one thread)
  and `tests/poly_bench.rs` (paced, a block a period on a promoted thread) as before, now
  playing their blocks through `Engine::render` between events, as the plug-in does.
  `poly_bench` also plays a factory preset (`CA72_PRESET`), shares the voices with workers
  (`CA72_WORKERS`, each block given the plug-in's deadline) and can put its own thread in a
  work interval as a CoreAudio IO thread is (`CA72_HOST_WG`). Both share the presets'
  controls and chords (`tests/common`).
- `tests/preset_render.rs` renders every factory preset at ten voices and compares it with
  a reference render: the same to the bit, or the difference's RMS and peak, the level and
  the largest third-octave band's change. Every change below was checked against the code
  before it this way.
- The Mac with Live closed, but not idle: other applications kept the load average at 4 to
  6 throughout (the window server among them). The same conditions before and after.

### Before (the Mac, 2026-10-02, the code before this record)
Each preset at ten voices, 256-frame blocks at 48 kHz (`preset_cost`, one thread, as fast
as it goes; the share of one core real time takes, and the worst block's share of the
period), and `poly_bench`'s own panel at ten voices (paced, 60 s):

| | Mean, of the period | p99.9 | Worst | Late blocks |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 frames (5.33 ms) | 88.0 % | 135 % | 138 % | 1,706 of 11,250 |
| 512 frames (10.67 ms) | 88.1 % | 130 % | 135 % | 764 of 5,625 |

The strip's count: 6 voices at 256 frames, none with FEEDBACK on. `preset_cost` per preset
is in the first columns of the table under "After".

### FEEDBACK nearly free
- Inside the loop the circuit's preamplifier (R8) cost a voice four to eight times over:
  Undertow Growl took 694 % of a core at ten voices, Pulse Strut 349 %.
- Why Potato's plain model misbehaved in the loop (R8): mostly time. The circuit's four
  substeps a sample run between halfband resamplers that delay its output 44.5 samples; the
  plain model has none, so its loop is some 45 samples shorter and falls into another
  oscillation. Recorded inside the loop (the circuit's input, sample by sample) and replayed
  open-loop, the plain model's output differs from the circuit's by -2 to +5 dB (the
  error's power against the signal's); its equations run at four times the rate inside the
  circuit's own resamplers, by -19 to -36 dB (`crates/ca72/src/voice/loop_lab.rs`).
- **The model** (`preamp::Delayed`, `InLoop::Delayed`, the default in Potato with FEEDBACK
  on): the plain model's equations at twice the rate between sparse halfband resamplers,
  its input delayed so that its output comes 44.5 samples late, as the circuit's does; the
  input's coupling, C20 and the lamp at the sample rate. Built with the preamplifier, so
  switching FEEDBACK on allocates nothing. A load-dependent low clip (R57 against R46 through
  C20, which sets the circuit's lower limit) was tried and left out: no closer.
- **Proof.** Open-loop on the recorded inputs, FEEDBACK 3, 6 and 10, EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME
  5 and 10, both FEEDBACK presets: the error -21 to -40 dB (plain: -2 to +5). In the loop
  the sound is chaotic (the circuit's own renders differ from one ANALOG seed to the next by
  up to 8 dB in a band), so the models were compared by their statistics over six seeds
  (`tests/feedback_models.rs`):

  | Preset, FEEDBACK, VOLUME | Level, dB: circuit | new | plain | Above 1 kHz, %: circuit | new | plain | Under 150 Hz, %: circuit | new | plain | Worst band, dB: new | plain |

  (The circuit's mean over the six seeds and its spread, one standard deviation; the new
  model's and the plain one's means over the same seeds; the largest change of a
  third-octave band, the power over the seeds, among the bands within 40 dB of the
  strongest.) The OVERLOAD lamp's mean is the same for all three in every case (dark at
  FEEDBACK 3 and VOLUME 5, lit otherwise). Two of the circuit's own renders, seeds 1 and 2,
  differ by up to 8.2 dB in a band (Undertow Growl, FEEDBACK 6, VOLUME 10).
  At VOLUME 0 nothing reaches the preamplifier and the three are the same. R8's test passes
  as before: Potato against High Fidelity at 30 %, level 0.540 and 0.540, brightness 30.6 %
  and 28.7 % (R8 had 30.5 %).
- **Cost:** FEEDBACK now adds what the overdriven voice itself costs (its VCA's pairs, the
  filter, harder driven), about a fifth: Undertow Growl 100 % of a core at ten voices on one
  thread (84 % with FEEDBACK at 0, measured with this change), Pulse Strut 88 %.

### A voice cheaper, the same samples
- **A voice at a time.** `Engine::render` plays the samples between one event and the next:
  each POLY voice 128 samples in turn rather than every voice a sample at a time, its state
  (some 30 KB) then staying in the nearest cache, the voices summed in the same order. About
  3 % on the Mac; it is also the shape a block takes to share the voices among threads.
- **Less work, to the bit:** the noise generator not run while nothing hears it (its mixer
  channel off and the modulation mix's gain from it exactly zero, or neither modulation
  switch on; it resumes where it stopped, as an unheard oscillator does); the filter's
  Jacobian and output gradient kept from step to step (the entries always zero stay zero)
  and its first-order correction taken over the entries that are not; the bus
  conductance's resampler skipped while the conductance holds; ANALOG's per-sample
  constants worked out once a rate; the contours' transistor parameters looked up once a
  tick. 2 to 10 % (Wooden Mallet the most).
- **Measured and left out:** link-time optimisation (`lto = "fat"`, one codegen unit): 3 to
  4 % faster, but every test binary of the workspace would link that way too (R13: the
  bundles alone are, now); caching the
  filter's per-bias divisions and reading its two output tables with shared weights, and an
  oscillator's repeated exponential: no gain the measurement could see.
- **Where a voice's time goes** (Three Saw Slab): the filter about a third, the
  oscillators a fifth (the reverse sawtooth among them), the VCA a sixth, the contours a
  tenth; the noise, the keyboard, the VCA's bias and the control node a few percent each.
  Running the contours eight times less often saved 9 to 15 %. A key change costs a voice
  about a third more in its block: on a note the keyboard circuit's Newton solve after its
  contacts jump, on a release the contours' trigger section. No further change found here
  halves a voice without changing its sound; the threads below do the rest.

### Worker threads
- **How** (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/pool.rs`; safe Rust, as `ca72::threaded`): the host's
  audio thread and up to four workers share each run of samples between events. Each voice
  sits behind a mutex that the audio thread only ever tries; the engine keeps each voice's
  note, gate and age itself, so events never wait on a voice. A run is offered through
  atomics: one word holds its number, its voices and the next to take, so a voice is taken
  by a compare-and-swap on it and a worker late from one run can take nothing from the
  next. The audio thread takes voices too, until none is left (any voice no worker has
  started, it plays itself), then waits for the workers' voices, spinning, yielding, then
  napping, until the block's deadline, 0.75 of its period, and no longer: a voice not done
  by then is silent for that run and sits out until its worker lets it go; a change meant
  for it (its panel, a lifted key) waits for it. Each voice's samples go to its own buffer
  and the audio thread sums them in the voices' order, so the output is the same to the bit
  with any number of workers (`tests/workers.rs`; `preset_render.rs`, all 17). Nothing
  allocates on the audio thread (`tests/realtime.rs`).
- **When:** with POLY on, two voices or more sounding and a run of at least 8 samples
  (waking the workers takes microseconds). POLY off, the one voice stays on the host's
  thread.
- **Threads:** started when the plug-in is activated (not on the audio thread), a third of
  the processors less two, at most four (four on the Mac's 14 and on the i5-13600K's 20,
  two on 8, none below 5), made audio threads for the host's largest block
  (`ca72_rt::promote`: on macOS the time-constraint policy, on Linux `SCHED_FIFO` with the
  watchdog, on Windows time-critical priority). They spin 200 us after a run (the block's
  next run follows at once), then park; the audio thread wakes them for each run.
- **A work interval of their own (macOS).** Paced as audio is, a thread busy a third of each
  period ran about half as fast as one busy for most of it: the system's performance
  controller does not raise the clock for threads it does not know work to a deadline (on
  one paced thread a voice's 256 samples took 708 us with 3 voices sounding, 433 with 10).
  The workers therefore join an `os_workgroup` interval of their own
  (`AudioWorkIntervalCreate`; `ca72_rt::WorkInterval`), which the first of them opens at a
  block's first run with the block's period as its deadline and closes when the block's runs
  are done; a worker leaves it before it ends. A plug-in cannot join its host's audio
  workgroup: VST3 has no way to hand it over and nih-plug's CLAP wrapper none either; nor
  can it put the host's thread into one safely (a thread that ends while joined stops the
  process). How fast the host's own thread runs is the host's: in the bench, with its thread
  in an interval of its own (as a CoreAudio IO thread is), the worst blocks fall by about a
  third.
- **The strip's count** (**since R12** not shown, nor measured when the plug-in is
  activated; `engine::realtime_voices` stays for `poly_bench`) measures the engine itself
  with its workers, paced at the block's period on an audio thread of its own for a moment,
  as a host plays it (chords of as many notes as voices tried, a new one every few blocks,
  the voices still sounding taken): the most voices whose key-change blocks take, at their
  median, no more than 60 % of the period; ten tried first, then down from the estimate,
  about a fifth of a second each, once a process for each rate, block, FEEDBACK and number
  of workers. That thread is not in a workgroup, so the count does not count on the host's
  being in one. On the Mac: 10 at 256 and 1024 frames, FEEDBACK on too; 4 with the host's
  thread alone (R7's paced figure on the Linux reference machine was 4).
- **Tests:** a voice still held by a late worker sits out and the block is not held up
  for it; a worker past the deadline is not waited for; the same samples with and without
  workers; no allocation with workers, FEEDBACK switched, VOICES changed and POLY switched.

### After (the Mac, 2026-10-02)
**`preset_cost`** (each preset at ten voices, 256 frames, as fast as it goes; the share of
one core real time takes and the worst block's share of the period; before: the code before
this record, the circuit's preamplifier in FEEDBACK's loop; after: this record, one thread
and with four workers, which here are ordinary threads since the measurement is not paced):

(Run as fast as it goes, its worst blocks include the other applications' turns: the
workers here are ordinary threads, so 78 to 96 % in three presets is that; the paced runs
below, on audio threads, are the measure.)

**`poly_bench`, its own panel** (ten voices, paced on a promoted thread, 60 s):

**`poly_bench`, every preset** (ten voices, four workers, paced on a promoted thread: 30 s
at 256 and 512 frames with the bench's own thread outside any workgroup, and 20 s at 256
with it in a work interval of its own, as a CoreAudio IO thread is; shares of the period):

No preset had a late block. With the host's thread in an interval every preset's worst
block is under 60 % of the period (41 to 51 %); with it outside one, the means stay under
half the period but the worst blocks, at the chord changes, reach 65 to 93 % at 256 frames
and 56 to 75 % at 512.

**The strip's count:** 10 voices at 256 and 1024 frames, FEEDBACK on too (6 and none
before); 4 with the host's thread alone.

**Old against new** (`preset_render`, every factory preset at ten voices, 4 s, against a
render of the code before): 15 the same to the bit; Pulse Strut and Undertow Growl, whose
FEEDBACK loop now runs the new preamplifier model: level +0.10 and -0.04 dB, the largest
third-octave band's change -0.91 dB at 1.26 kHz and +1.31 dB at 20 kHz; their difference
signals are about as loud as the renders (+0.4 and +2.5 dB), as two renders of a chaotic
loop are once they part (above).

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-02, the release bundles of this version, Live closed):**
clap-validator 0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10,
SUCCESS, its editor tests run this time; Steinberg's validator (SDK 3.8.1), 47 passed, 0
failed. The workspace's tests (155 passed, 0 failed, 20 by hand) and clippy pass on the
Mac. The bundles are installed for Live.

### Limitations
- The host's own thread: in a host whose audio threads are not in a workgroup, its share of
  the voices runs slower (paced and lightly loaded, the system clocks it down), and the
  worst blocks at a chord change rise to 65 to 93 % of the period at 256 frames (no block
  late in these runs); with it in one, 41 to 51 %. Whether Live 12's threads are is for the
  check in Live to show.
- Windows and Linux were not measured for this record (the Linux reference machine and the
  Windows one, an i5-13600K): the
  workers start there too (four on the i5's 20 processors), without a work interval.
- A worker held up past the deadline (a machine overloaded by other work) costs that voice
  its samples for the run: a gap in one voice rather than a dropout of all.
- VOICES still defaults to 4.

### For the DAW's instrument (its own copy of the model; porting left for later)
- The FEEDBACK finding and model, if its loop runs the circuit's preamplifier in Potato
  (`preamp::Delayed`, `InLoop`; the open-loop lab and the in-loop comparison).
- The bit-exact savings: the noise while unheard (`ControlPart`), the filter's sparse
  Jacobian and held conductance (`vcf.rs`), the character's constants (the DAW's character
  module), the contours' devices once a tick.
- The engine's runs between events and its threads belong to the DAW's own engine and pool,
  not to the model; the macOS work interval (`ca72_rt::WorkInterval`) is a candidate for
  the DAW's real-time threads.

## R12. One row under the panel; a preset holds POLY, VOICES, ANALOG and SPREAD
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-02**, trying R11's build in Live: the strip's real-time count
("10 in real time here ..."), which the owner found unhelpful and a waste of space, is
gone, and CA-72's label with it, the presets' selector brought up into the strip's row; the
presets' list scrolls with the mouse wheel and touch gestures (it did with neither); POLY,
VOICES, ANALOG and SPREAD are saved with a preset.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):
- **One row.** The strip's left (to 1110 panel units) is the presets' selector: its star,
  the previous preset, the name (680 units, the drawer's arrow inside), the next and SAVE…;
  then POLY and VOICES where the count was; ANALOG and SPREAD where they were. The bar's
  PRESET label went: the star, the arrows and SAVE… say what it is. The window is 80 panel
  units shorter (577 pixels tall at 1720 wide, as before R10's bar); the drawer opens below
  the strip. `ca72-panel`: `presets::bar_svg` draws the selector into the strip's frame
  (one renderer instead of two); `strip::hit` leaves the selector to `presets::bar_hit`.
  Tests: the row's parts do not overlap (each label measured in the strip's face), the
  selector's controls found where drawn, the window's heights.
- **No real-time count**: the strip shows none and VOICES is no longer marked; the plug-in
  no longer measures one when it is activated (half a second saved). R11's measurement stays
  as `engine::realtime_voices`, for `poly_bench`.
- **The list scrolls a row for each row's travel**: a wheel's lines as they come (on macOS a
  slow turn gives fractions of one), a trackpad's or a Magic Mouse's points as rows of the
  list at the window's size (a row is 62 panel units), the rest kept for the next event; a
  turn the other way starts again. Each such event is a few points, and the half-notch
  threshold before dropped every one. Test: `small_scrolls_add_up_to_rows`.
- **A preset sets POLY, VOICES, ANALOG and SPREAD** like every other parameter, to its value
  or the default (R10 left POLY and VOICES alone when a preset did not name them, and the
  factory presets named none of the four, so choosing one put ANALOG and SPREAD to 0). A
  preset saved already held all four. Every factory preset now names them: Brass Tutti
  POLY on, 8 voices, ANALOG 40 %, SPREAD 50 %; Wooden Mallet POLY on, 8, 20 %, 60 %; the
  other fifteen, documented mono patches, POLY off, 4 voices, ANALOG and SPREAD 0 (as they
  were). Test: `presets::tests`.
- **The DAW** carries the factory file byte for byte (R10); its copy now differs by these
  four keys in each preset, and its instrument's choosing of a preset by the same rule:
  both to port.

## R13. How much lighter ten voices can be
**Owner's question, 2026-10-02**, trying R11's build in Live: Live's CPU meter reaches
about 40 % with FEEDBACK and ten POLY voices. The owner asked whether more speed could be
had without losing audio quality, or large gains from a small concession, concerned that it
was too heavy for many people's computers. Two changes that keep the sound are built; the
concessions were measured and left for the owner to decide (any audible change is theirs).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-02** (not separately approved):

### Measuring
- `preset_cost` (ten voices on one thread, as fast as it goes), the least of three 5 s
  runs, the builds interleaved. Live was open with the owner's Set, so a share of a core
  here is a few percent above R11's (Live closed): compare within a row.
- The sound against a render of the code before (`preset_render`, every factory preset at
  ten voices, 4 s), as in R11.

### The same sound, a little less work
- **The pairs' tanh, fast inside a tick.** A transistor pair's tanh anchor (`PairWarm`: the
  VCA's three pairs, the filter's in High Fidelity) takes `ulp::tanh_in_tick`: inside a High
  Fidelity or Potato part's tick `fast::tanh` (within 2e-14 of libm's, relatively), as
  `ulp::exp` already was; No Compromises and the factory calibration (outside a tick) keep
  libm's. A voice in Potato takes some 35,000 of them a second (Bass). Against the code
  before: 14 presets the same to the bit, Upright Pluck and Pulse Strut differ at -263 and
  -166 dB; Undertow Growl's FEEDBACK loop, chaotic, parts from the old render as any change
  of rounding makes it do (its difference as loud as the render, the level +0.04 dB, the
  largest third-octave band's change +1.3 dB at 20 Hz, inside R11's spread from one ANALOG
  seed to the next of up to 8 dB). 1 to 2 % faster.
- **The bundles link-time optimised:** `[profile.bundle]` (release, `lto = "fat"`, one
  codegen unit), built by `cargo xtask bundle ca72-plugin --profile bundle` in CI, the
  README and `scripts/validate.sh`; the tests stay on `release`, which links far faster.
  Every preset the same to the bit as `release`. 2 to 4 % faster. Its build output takes
  about half a gigabyte more under `target/bundle`.
- Together, a share of one core at ten voices:

  | Preset | Before | Fast tanh | And link-time optimised | Change |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Undertow Growl | 100.1 % | 98.1 % | 94.5 % | -5.6 % |
  | Pulse Strut | 89.8 % | 88.4 % | 84.9 % | -5.5 % |
  | Three Saw Slab | 79.2 % | 78.6 % | 75.7 % | -4.4 % |
  | Brass Tutti | 76.6 % | 75.4 % | 72.5 % | -5.4 % |
  | Wooden Mallet | 53.5 % | 52.9 % | 51.2 % | -4.3 % |

- **Measured and not built:** the workers spinning 50 us rather than 200 after a run
  before they park. Four workers spin up to 0.8 ms a block, some 15 % of a core at 256
  frames that Live's meter does not show but other tracks' threads could use; whether the
  shorter spin makes a block late wants a paced run with Live closed.
- **Nothing more to the bit** that the measurement can see (R11 tried the filter's
  divisions and tables and the oscillators' exponentials). A large gain with the same
  samples would need the voices computed side by side, two to a NEON register (four to
  AVX2's), each operation the same in every lane, the solvers' iterations masked lane by
  lane: a rewrite of the voice's data and its solvers, its gain not measured.

### Concessions, measured (none built)
Each switched on alone in Potato for the measurement (and removed): its cost against the
same build without it (Undertow Growl, Three Saw Slab, Wooden Mallet, Brass Tutti), and
its sound against the reference render (17 presets):

| Concession | Cost | Sound |
|---|---:|---|
| The filter at the host's rate, not twice it | -12 to -23 % | the top octave 2 to 8 dB down in most presets; Cruising Whistle +3.5 dB at 12.7 kHz; FEEDBACK's loop another (Pulse Strut +15 dB at 630 Hz, Undertow Growl +24 dB at 20 Hz) |
| The filter's Newton solve one iteration a step, not two | -2 to -3 % (Undertow Growl -18 %) | the ordinary presets within 0.5 dB in every band; FEEDBACK's loop another (Undertow Growl +19 dB at 20 Hz) |
| The contours at a sixteenth of the rate, not an eighth | -2 to -8 % | attacks click: Bass +10 dB at 10 kHz, Upright Pluck +4 dB at 6.3 kHz |
| The keyboard circuit at a sixteenth of the rate | about -1 % | not compared |
| All of them | -22 to -38 % | all of the above |

So no small concession gives a large gain: the circuit's cheapest voice is 1.3 to 1.6
times cheaper and audibly another. A voice's cost is the circuit itself (R11: the filter a
third, the oscillators a fifth, the VCA a sixth). Five times cheaper or more would take
another model of the voice for POLY (the filter as a ladder of one-pole stages around one
nonlinearity, the oscillators as band-limited waveforms): another instrument than the
circuit's, and a second quality in the plug-in against R1's one; the owner's to decide.

### What ten voices ask of a machine
- On the M4 Pro a voice takes 5 to 10 % of a core (Wooden Mallet the least, Undertow
  Growl the most): ten voices about half a core's work to a core's, shared by the host's
  thread and the workers (R11: a third of the processors less two, at most four: none
  below 5 processors, one at 5 to 7, two at 8 to 10, three at 11 to 13). Live's meter shows
  the host's thread's block against its period, waiting for the workers' voices included:
  about a fifth of the work at ten voices with four workers, and its worst blocks.
- A machine of 8 processors (two workers) shares the voices three ways; one of 4 (none)
  plays them all on the host's thread, where ten voices of the heavier presets would need
  a core faster than the M4 Pro's (one of its cores holds five or six of them within 60 %
  of the period; a slower core fewer). Windows and Linux are still not measured.
- VOICES defaults to 4; Brass Tutti and Wooden Mallet set 8 (R12).

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-02, the bundles of this version built with `--profile
bundle`, Live open):** clap-validator 0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval
1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS (its editor tests skipped while Live was open); Steinberg's
validator (SDK 3.8.1), 47 passed, 0 failed. The workspace's tests (157 passed, 0 failed, 20
by hand) and clippy pass. The bundles, with R12's changes, are installed for Live.

### For the DAW's instrument
- The pairs' fast tanh inside a tick (`ulp::tanh_in_tick`, `PairWarm`), if its copy of the
  model has the anchors.

## R14. ANALOG is ENTROPY
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-03:** ANALOG is renamed ENTROPY; its parameter id may change
too, as long as it is the same everywhere; and no compatibility with what was saved before
(below).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **ENTROPY everywhere:** the strip's label, the parameter's name in a host ("Entropy") and
  its id (`entropy`), the presets' key (`entropy`, the factory file's seventeen included),
  the README, and the code's names (the engine's control and `ENTROPY_DEPTH` with its kin,
  the character's `entropy` figures, `crates/ca72/tests/entropy.rs`). What it does is
  unchanged. The strip's label fits before its slider (the row's parts measured as in
  R12).
- **No compatibility kept** (the owner, 2026-10-03, saw no need for it, since no one had
  used the plug-in outside testing): a session or a preset saved with ANALOG's `analog`
  opens with ENTROPY at its default, and a host's automation of ANALOG no longer reaches
  it.
- The records before this one keep the name ANALOG, as written then.
- **The DAW** reads the plug-in's presets by the same keys (R10): until its instrument
  takes the name too (its control, its key and its copy of the factory file), each
  program's presets hold the amount under a key the other does not know. To port, with
  R12's keys.

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-03, the bundles of this version, Live open):** clap-validator
0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS (its editor
tests skipped while Live was open); Steinberg's validator, 47 passed, 0 failed. The
workspace's tests (157 passed, 0 failed, 20 by hand) and clippy pass. The bundles are
installed for Live.

## R15. Six factory presets: the launch film's drums and riser
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-03:** the agent made the CA-72's launch film with every sound on
the model, the drums included. The owner then asked for these sounds to be added to the
factory presets, in the DAW and in the VST3 and CLAP plug-ins, and for the film to make
clear that every sound is the CA-72.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **Six presets after the seventeen, 23 in all:** Ladder Kick, Noise Snare, Closed Hat,
  Open Hat, Noise Crash and Pink Riser, tagged `drums` (with `kick`, `snare`, `hi-hat`,
  `cymbal`, `noise`, `percussive`) or `fx` and `riser`. Every control is named, as in the
  documented patches; POLY off, VOICES 4, ENTROPY and SPREAD 0 (R12). A preset is one
  monophonic instrument, so a kit takes one instance a drum.
- **Each works from the panel alone.** A preset holds neither the PITCH wheel nor
  automation, so the film's first kick (a triangle with the PITCH wheel swept 16 semitones
  down on each hit) and riser (CUTOFF automated over 8 s) were redesigned to do it
  themselves (measured on the model):
  - **Ladder Kick:** a triangle at 32' into a filter whose EMPHASIS (9.6) sits just under
    oscillation. A 0.2 FILTER DECAY sweeps the ring from about 540 Hz into the low end
    within 30 ms, over the triangle's 55 Hz on MIDI note 57. Longer, wider sweeps (EMPHASIS
    8 to 10, AMOUNT OF CONTOUR 6 to 8) lingered in the mids: their energy below 120 Hz was 8
    to 19 dB under the whole, against 1.7 dB here.
  - **Pink Riser:** FILTER ATTACK at 10 opens a resonant pink noise (EMPHASIS 7, CUTOFF
    -3.5, AMOUNT OF CONTOUR 10) over about 4.5 s, while the loudness swells (ATTACK 6).
  - The snare, the hats and the crash are the film's patches: noise with the filter open
    (a triangle at 7 for the snare's body, MIDI 54 about 185 Hz), told apart by DECAY.
- **The film was rendered again with these presets as they are** (no value changed, no
  automation), so its drums are these.
- **Levelled as the first seventeen:** MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME for about -18 LUFS momentary
  maximum on a phrase in each one's register. Noise Crash 9.7 (-17.9). The other five are
  under it at 10, quiet by nature: Ladder Kick -22.9 (LUFS weighs the lows lightly; a
  second triangle added 0.6 dB), Noise Snare -20.6, Closed Hat -20.7, Open Hat -20.8, Pink
  Riser -25.6.
- **The editor's test of the drawer over the panel** clicked "Lead" by name. With Closed
  Hat and Ladder Kick sorting before it, Lead left the list's first page and the test failed.
  It now clicks the first page's second row, whichever preset that is.
- **The DAW** carries the same six in its copy of the file (on a branch of its own),
  without R12's four keys, which it has not ported. Its golden renders record each.

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-03, the bundles of this version, Live open):** clap-validator
0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS;
Steinberg's validator, 47 passed, 0 failed. The workspace's tests (157 passed, 0 failed, 20
by hand), clippy and rustfmt pass. Both installed bundles carry the 23 presets. They are
installed for Live, the ones they replaced kept aside.

## R16. Warped Pad, the IDM film's pad, as a factory preset
**Owner decision, 2026-10-03:** after the launch film's IDM version, the owner asked for
its pad to become a preset if it was not one already.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **Warped Pad, the 24th preset:** two sawtooths a hair apart (oscillator 2 at +0.1), the
  filter opened slowly (CUTOFF -1.5, EMPHASIS 2, AMOUNT OF CONTOUR 2, ATTACK 5) and a slow
  vibrato from oscillator 3 at LO (MOD wheel 0.03). POLY is on with eight voices, ENTROPY 85
  and SPREAD 80; the drift is the point of it. The film automated CUTOFF and moved ENTROPY
  between 60 and 100; the preset holds the values of the film's last section.
- **Levelled as the others:** MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME 7.8, -18.0 LUFS momentary maximum on three
  held six-note chords.
- The DAW's copy names POLY, VOICES, ENTROPY and SPREAD for this preset, since the pad's
  sound depends on them. It is the first preset in that copy to name all four.

**Evidence (the Mac, 2026-10-03, the bundles of this version, Live open):** clap-validator
0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS;
Steinberg's validator, 47 passed, 0 failed. The workspace's tests (157 passed, 0 failed, 20
by hand) pass. Both installed bundles carry the 24 presets.

## R17. Installers, and a README that starts with them
**Owner's request, 2026-10-03**, preparing the open-source launch: installation and setup
instructions that are clear and concise, as easy as possible for people, perhaps with an
installer.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **An installer for each platform**, made from the bundles by `scripts/package.sh` on the
  platform it runs on, and by CI on every run (artifacts `CA-72-<platform>-installer`):
  - **macOS:** `CA-72-<version>-macOS.pkg` (pkgbuild, productbuild), universal, macOS 11 or
    later. It installs `CA-72.vst3` and `CA-72.clap` for every user into
    `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` and `.../CLAP`, each format a choice; it asks for an
    administrator's password, as plug-in installers do. The bundles are not relocatable
    (Installer would otherwise put them wherever it finds a bundle of the same identifier,
    a build folder say) and not version-checked (any version installs over any other).
  - **Windows:** `CA-72-<version>-Windows-setup.exe` (Inno Setup 6,
    `scripts/installer/CA-72.iss`), 64-bit, Windows 10 or later. It installs into
    `Common Files\VST3` and `Common Files\CLAP`, each format a component, with an
    uninstaller in Settings' Apps and the licence and notices in `Program Files\Idle
    Foundry\CA-72`. Its AppId must never change.
  - **Linux:** `CA-72-<version>-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz` with `install.sh`: for the user into
    `~/.vst3` and `~/.clap`, `--system` into `/usr/lib/vst3` and `/usr/lib/clap`,
    `--uninstall`. It warns when X11's client libraries are missing.
- **Unsigned for now**, as R4 waits for the owner's Developer ID. The README says how to
  open them past Gatekeeper and SmartScreen once. Files an installer writes carry no
  quarantine flag, so the README's `xattr` step is gone. `package.sh` signs and notarises
  when given identities and a notarytool profile (`CA72_MACOS_SIGN_APP`,
  `CA72_MACOS_SIGN_INSTALLER`, `CA72_NOTARY_PROFILE`); CI does not yet, which needs the
  certificates as secrets.
- **The bundles' Info.plist on macOS:** nih-plug's bundler writes the identifier
  `com.nih-plug.ca72-plugin` and version 1.0.0. The installer's copies carry
  `com.idlefoundry.ca-72.vst3` and `.clap`, the crate's version and macOS 11 as their
  minimum, and are signed again (ad hoc).
- **macOS 11 is the minimum.** The audio workgroups (R11) are macOS 11's and are linked as
  required, while the toolchain's default for the Intel slice is 10.12: it would have
  failed to load on 10.12 to 10.15. `.cargo/config.toml` sets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`
  to 11.0 (checked: both slices say 11.0).
- **Linux's bundles are built on Ubuntu 22.04** in CI (24.04 before), so that they load
  where the C library is glibc 2.35 or later.
- **Third-party notices.** The plug-ins' binaries include some 190 crates (MIT,
  Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Zlib and others) whose licences ask for their notices to go with
  every copy. `scripts/notices.py` writes `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` from Cargo.lock for
  every platform released: each crate's own licence files, MIT's where a crate offers it
  among others, the standard MIT text with its authors where a crate ships none, and the
  font's licence. CI checks that it is current. Every installer carries it and LICENSE
  beside the plug-ins and inside each bundle that has room.
- **A release:** a tag `v<version>` runs CI and drafts a GitHub release of the three
  installers, their SHA-256 sums and the notices, for the owner to publish.
- **The README** opens with downloading and running the installer, the warnings while
  unsigned, the folders, and uninstalling. Building from source lists each platform's
  prerequisites (rustup; Xcode's command line tools, Visual Studio's Build Tools, or
  Linux's packages for Debian and Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch), cloning, how long the build
  and tests take, and `validate.sh`'s own needs.

**Evidence (2026-10-03).** The README's Building and Testing followed on the three
reference machines, from a fresh clone from GitHub with an empty cargo cache:

| | Mac (M4 Pro, macOS 27) | Linux (Ryzen 7 7800X3D) | Windows 11 (i5-13600K) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bundles (`--profile bundle`) | 93 s | 35 s | 69 s |
| `cargo test --workspace` | 157 passed, 0 failed (164 s) | 158 passed, 0 failed (470 s) | 157 passed, 0 failed (218 s) |
| Standalone built | yes | yes | yes |
| clap-validator 0.4.1 | 37 passed, 7 skipped | 37 passed, 7 skipped | 36 passed, 8 skipped (one runs on Unix only) |
| pluginval 1.0.4, strictness 10 | SUCCESS, editor tests skipped (Live open) | SUCCESS, editor tests skipped (no display) | SUCCESS, editor tests included |
| Steinberg's validator, SDK 3.8.1 | 47 passed | 47 passed | not built: the SDK needs Visual Studio, and this machine builds with MinGW |
| Installed copies validated | yes | yes | CLAP yes |

On Windows, pluginval's editor test crashed when run over SSH (no desktop) and passed in
the desktop session. The installers, made by `package.sh` from this branch:
- **macOS:** the `.pkg`'s payload is the staged bundles to the byte, each bundle's
  signature valid within it, both slices macOS 11.0; its bundles pass clap-validator (37
  passed), pluginval at strictness 10 (SUCCESS, editor tests skipped while Live was open)
  and Steinberg's validator (47 passed). Not installed on the Mac (that needs an
  administrator, and the owner's own build in `~/Library` was in use by Live), and the
  Intel slice not run (no Rosetta).
- **Linux:** unpacked and `./install.sh` run, the installed copies pass clap-validator and
  Steinberg's validator; installing again, `--uninstall` and `--help` behave.
- **Windows** (Inno Setup 6.7.3 installed for it, with the owner's approval): the setup
  program installed silently (exit 0) into `Common Files\VST3` and `\CLAP` with the licence,
  the notices and an uninstaller in `Program Files\Idle Foundry\CA-72`, and an entry
  "CA-72 0.1.0, Idle Foundry" in Settings' Apps; the installed copies pass clap-validator
  and pluginval at strictness 10; it installs again over itself (VST3 only); its
  uninstaller removes everything it wrote, the folders it made included.

## R18. Before the release: a review's findings fixed, the name plate fixed, a new home
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-03.** Preparing the open-source launch, the owner asked for a
review of the code and an install test on the three reference machines, and for every
issue the review found to be fixed; and for R1's name plate to stop turning over. The
CA-72's public home is the Idle Foundry organisation, `github.com/idlefoundry/ca-72`. R17's
installers were approved, and the 24 presets (R15, R16), the installers and these fixes go
to `main` together.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved), by part:

### Three factory presets, as the owner changed them
**Owner decision, 2026-10-03:** the owner saved three factory presets anew from the panel
and asked for the changes to be made permanent. In `sounds/presets.toml`, to the values the
controls show:
- **Slow Horn Swell:** POLY on, VOICES 10, ENTROPY 25 % (saved as 24.96).
- **Undertow Growl:** FEEDBACK 3.8 (saved as 3.8022) and MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME 9.17 (9.167),
  so no longer levelled as R15's presets were.
- **Wooden Mallet:** POLY off (R12 had it on with eight voices; VOICES 8, ENTROPY 20 and
  SPREAD 60 stay for when POLY is switched on).
- **Upright Pluck** (asked later the same day): the three oscillators' VOLUME at 10 (8
  before). Only oscillator 1 sounds in it, now louder into the mixer.

### The name plate
- It no longer turns over (R1's "Model DEEZ" is gone, with its click and its animation). It
  always shows CA-72 and its maker, at the width it had (261 units), so the panel is the
  same to the pixel.

### The voices on the audio thread
- **Exports and freezes wait for every voice.** The deadline (R11) applies only in real time:
  the processing mode is read each block (nih-plug's `ProcessContext::process_mode`, below),
  since CLAP may switch to offline without initialising the plug-in again. A voice that
  misses a run keeps its level for the silence test, so it is not freed and its tail is not
  cut.
- **After the deadline the block's later runs play on the host's thread**, rather than being
  handed to workers and lost: the block is late rather than voices silent.
- **A sample that is not finite** on the side chain is read as 0. A voice whose output goes
  non-finite is silent until a clean voice takes its place: a spare for each voice, made off
  the audio thread when the plug-in is prepared and made again on nih-plug's background
  thread after use. The output is never NaN. (Ten spare voices an instance: memory, no
  work.)
- **All Sound Off (CC 120) silences at once:** a 5 ms fade, every sounding voice replaced by a
  clean one, then POWER's 10 ms fade in. All notes off (CC 123) still releases the notes.
- **A state loaded into a running instance** (CLAP and VST3 initialise the plug-in again
  for it) keeps its workers when their count and period are unchanged, so a host's preset
  change no longer drops out; a new seed draws ENTROPY's characters again, so a session
  plays as it did when saved. A session saved before R14 opens with ENTROPY at its default.
- A retrigger due for a voice that did not play a run is kept for the next.

### The plug-in's threads
- **Every instance in a process shares one budget of workers** (R11's count, at most four):
  an instance that finds none plays its voices on the host's thread. An instance with POLY
  off still takes its share when activated (starting workers when POLY turns on would mean
  starting them off the audio thread on demand; not done).
- **A late worker cannot touch a later run:** a worker that finds its run closed leaves the
  voice alone (that voice does not advance for the run), and each voice's mark is its own.
- **Workers take the host thread's flush-to-zero bits** for each run, so a voice's samples
  are the same on any thread. DAZ is not forced where the host has not set it, for the same
  reason.
- **Windows:** workers join MMCSS's "Pro Audio" task at critical priority (time-critical
  priority if that fails), and the host's thread spins rather than sleeping while it waits.
- **Linux:** the watchdog (R11) demotes only the threads it promoted, never the host's or
  other plug-ins'; its messages begin `ca72:`, and the real-time limit's message prints at
  most once. Its threads park while no promoted thread lives.
- Nits: no Mach port leaked a worker; a worker that fails to start stops the others; the
  lab's threads are `ca72-*`.

### The presets' library (R10)
- **Names:** `factory` (the overlay's file) and Windows' device names (CON, NUL, COM1 and
  so on) are refused on every system, in any case; names are one preset regardless of case
  on every file system.
- **Writes go to the preset's own file**, which keeps its name unless no other file has the
  new one; a name read from a file is checked as one typed (`../x` or an absolute path is
  reported, not listed).
- **An overlay that cannot be read is left as it is,** and marking a factory preset reports
  why; the overlay is edited in place, keeping keys this version does not know.
- **An edit stays with its preset** (by name and origin) while the list filters, refreshes or
  loses it; a preset gone meanwhile is reported.
- **The library is read again only when its files change**, and search and tags work on what
  was read, off the disk.
- **MIDI BEND RANGE is the player's,** not the sound's: choosing a preset that does not name
  it leaves it as it is, and the plug-in's own saves no longer write it (a file that names
  it still sets it).
- **The factory file is `sounds/presets.toml`,** its comments without trademarks or the
  DAW's name (R1: the file is inside every bundle); Ladder Kick is "a booming electronic
  kick". R10's "byte for byte" with the DAW's copy no longer holds for the comments.

### The editor (R5, R6, R10)
- **Linux:** the drawer no longer takes the keyboard by asking for focus (baseview's X11
  window does not implement it and panicked, closing the editor). X11 gives the editor the
  keys while the pointer is over it.
- **Windows:** when the drawer shuts it gives the keyboard back to the window that had it.
- **Scale:** on Windows and Linux the editor uses the host's scale, or exactly 1 when the
  host gives none (Live), so the drawing, the window and the pointer agree (at 150 % the
  pointer had landed at two thirds of its place).
- **Linux's first size** is the monitor the pointer is on, else the primary (RandR, through
  x11rb), less the desktop's panels; not the whole X screen.
- **The drawer opens over the panel** when the window with it below would not fit on the
  screen, or when the host refuses to resize (VST3 now reports a refusal on macOS and
  Windows; below).
- **Gestures never nest:** a wheel's gesture, a drag or a slider is ended before any other
  begins, when the window loses focus, and when the editor closes; on Windows a drag whose
  mouse capture was lost ends, and the capture is released.
- The editor reopens at its own size (not the drawer's); the grip asks the host for a size
  at most once a frame; names with characters XML forbids no longer blank the drawer;
  without a parent window or a display no window opens, and softbuffer's failures stop the
  drawing rather than the host. The approved-image test prints its margin (mean 1.245,
  99th percentile 26, against 1.5 and 32, the same on Apple silicon and x86-64).
- `docs/panel.png` is drawn again, with the strip under the panel.

### nih-plug (`third_party/nih-plug/PATCHES.md`, changes 4 to 8)
- A VST3 host's refusal to resize reaches the editor; auxiliary buses are bounded by the
  host's own counts (two read one past the end of the host's array); a side chain's missing
  channels are as long as the block; VST3's buffer configuration carries the processing mode
  just set; and `ProcessContext::process_mode()`.

### Building, testing, the repository
- `scripts/validate.sh` fetches the validators with curl (no GitHub CLI), checked against
  their SHA-256, and `CA72_SKIP_GUI_TESTS=1` leaves out pluginval's editor tests.
- `scripts/fetch-sources.sh` finds its manifest again and fails when a source cannot be
  fetched or does not match.
- The circuit tests ask for ngspice 47, the reference measurements' version, and skip (or,
  with `CA72_REQUIRE_NGSPICE`, fail) with another.
- Timing tests: the two measurements of what a machine plays are run by hand; the engine's
  deadline tests no longer depend on a worker being scheduled within milliseconds.
- CI builds the standalone. LICENSE is the GPL's canonical text. CONTRIBUTING.md and
  SECURITY.md. The repository's URL, the plug-in's (shown by hosts) and the installers'
  are `github.com/idlefoundry/ca-72`.

**Evidence (2026-10-03).**
- **The three reference machines,** from this release's code before it was published:
  the Mac (Apple M4 Pro, macOS 27), 201 tests passed, 0 failed (22 run by hand), clippy,
  rustfmt and the notices' check, the universal bundles and the `.pkg`, clap-validator 37
  passed (7 skipped), pluginval at strictness 10 SUCCESS (editor tests skipped while Live
  was open), Steinberg's validator 47 passed; the Linux reference machine (Ryzen 7 7800X3D),
  202 passed, 0 failed, the tarball, the same validators (editor tests skipped: no
  display); the Windows machine (i5-13600K, Windows 11, the GNU toolchain), 200 passed, 0
  failed, the setup program and the standalone.
- **CI** (macOS 15, Windows Server 2025, Ubuntu 22.04): every job green, with ngspice 47
  required on Linux and the three validators on each system.
- **The installers CI made, each installed on a machine without the CA-72:**
  - **Linux:** `install.sh` into `~/.vst3` and `~/.clap`; the plug-in needs glibc 2.35 at
    most (Ubuntu 22.04's); the installed copies pass clap-validator (37 passed), pluginval
    at strictness 10 (SUCCESS, editor tests skipped) and Steinberg's validator (47 passed);
    `--uninstall` leaves nothing. The owner then played it in Bitwig Studio, CLAP and VST3.
  - **Windows:** the downloaded setup program, unsigned, met SmartScreen's warning, as the
    README says; allowed, it installed (exit 0), "CA-72 0.1.0, Idle Foundry" in Settings'
    Apps; the installed copies pass clap-validator (36 passed, 8 skipped: one test runs on
    Unix only) and pluginval at strictness 10 with its editor tests (SUCCESS, in the
    desktop session); its uninstaller leaves nothing, the folders it made included.
  - **macOS:** Gatekeeper would not open the downloaded package until Open Anyway in
    Privacy & Security, as the README says; the owner installed it. In
    `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins`: universal, 0.1.0, macOS 11, `com.idlefoundry.ca-72.vst3` and
    `.clap`, signatures valid, no quarantine flag, the licence and notices inside; they pass
    clap-validator (37 passed), pluginval at strictness 10 with its editor tests (SUCCESS)
    and Steinberg's validator (47 passed).

## R19. Two editor fixes after the installers were tried
**The owner's reports, 2026-10-03,** trying the installed plug-in: in Bitwig Studio on the
Linux reference machine, CLAP, the editor opened black until the pointer moved over it; on
macOS in Live, the presets' drawer, opened below the strip, did not shut the way it opened:
it jumped up over the panel and slid down off it, and when that was fixed, it flickered at
the moment it had shut.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (the owner confirmed the first three fixes in the hosts they were found in):
- **Linux: the frame shown again every quarter second.** The editor drew only when its frame
  changed (R5), the first frame once. X11 drops what is drawn to a window not yet on screen,
  and Bitwig maps the editor's window after that first frame; without a compositor it also
  drops what a covering window hid; baseview reports neither. On Linux the last frame is now
  shown again, unchanged, every 250 ms (a copy, no rendering). macOS and Windows keep a
  window's pixels and are unchanged.
- **The drawer shuts as it opened.** Shutting below the strip had shrunk the window at once,
  so the drawer's slide (still running) was drawn as the over-the-panel one (R10, R18). Now
  the window keeps its height while the drawer slides back up under the strip (140 ms), and
  shrinks when it has; the over-the-panel drawer is unchanged.
- **The window shrinks in one frame.** The host was asked for the shorter window while a
  frame was drawn, and the editor's view followed only in the next: on macOS, for that
  frame, the tall view sat in the short window with its top cut off. The view now follows in
  the same frame, before anything is shown.
- **The width is measured once an opening.** Until the grip sets a width, the editor's was
  fitted to the screen afresh at each of the host's questions, and the drawer asks again as
  it opens and shuts; on Linux the screen is the monitor under the pointer (R18), so the
  width, and the panel's scale, could change with the drawer. It is now fitted as the editor
  opens and kept until it closes.
- **A worker lets a voice go before marking it played.** R18's fencing of late workers had
  the mark stored while the voice's lock was still held: the caller's thread could see the
  mark, close the run, take the voice in the next and fail its `try_lock`, the voice then
  silent for that run. CI on macOS caught it as a FEEDBACK preset's samples differing between
  one thread and four (`tests/workers.rs`); the lock is now released first.

**Evidence (2026-10-03):** the plug-in's library tests (65 passed, among them
`the_drawer_shuts_the_way_it_opened`, `a_frame_is_shown_again_on_linux_only` and
`the_width_stays_while_the_drawer_opens_and_shuts`) and clippy on
macOS and Linux, clippy for Windows; the owner, in Bitwig on Linux (CLAP) and in Live on
macOS, with the builds of these changes.

## R20. Developer ID signing and notarization
**Owner's request, 2026-10-03:** set up Apple Developer ID for CA-72 so people installing
it on a Mac are recognized as receiving software from a trusted developer.

- Developer ID Application and Developer ID Installer certificates were issued for
  Idle Foundry Ltd., team `3JA8JUZ36W`, with the owner's approval. Both identities and
  private keys are installed in this Mac's login Keychain; encrypted backups and the
  local release configuration are outside the repository. Notarization credentials
  were entered by the owner and stored as the `CA72_NOTARY` Keychain profile.
- A universal 0.1.0 installer from main was signed, accepted by Apple's notary service,
  stapled and validated. Both payload bundles pass strict signature verification and
  contain x86_64 and arm64; their signatures include hardened runtime and a trusted
  timestamp. Gatekeeper accepts the installer as `Notarized Developer ID`, including a
  copy carrying the download quarantine attribute. It also opens normally in Installer.
- `CA72_REQUIRE_NOTARIZATION=1` makes public Mac packaging require both Developer ID
  identities and a notarization profile. Partial signing configuration is rejected.
  Apple must return `Accepted`; the ticket, installer signature and Gatekeeper policy
  are checked before the final distributable is replaced. A missing-profile failure
  was verified to preserve the previous installer.
- `docs/macos-release.md` records the reproducible local release procedure. Hosted CI
  signing secrets are not configured by this change; its unsigned macOS artifacts must
  not be published as the trusted installer. No signing private key or password is
  committed to the repository.

## R21. POLY's workers only while POLY is on; the copyright holder
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-03.** Of R18's note that an instance with POLY off still took its
share of the workers: it "should be fixed, absolutely". The copyright holder is Idle Foundry
Ltd., the company that holds the Developer ID (R20); the brand in hosts stays Idle Foundry.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **An instance holds workers only while its POLY is on.** At activation it starts them only
  if POLY is on. When POLY is switched on, the audio thread asks for them and plays every
  voice itself until they come; nih-plug's background thread (as for the spare voices, R18)
  starts the pool and hands it over through a slot the audio thread only tries to lock.
  When POLY is switched off, or the plug-in is deactivated, the pool is given back and
  stopped on the background thread, its workers returned to the budget. Nothing is
  allocated, waited for or started on the audio thread; the sound is the same either way
  (R11). A state load at the same rate and period keeps running workers (R19).
- Still first come, first served among instances with POLY on: one that found none plays on
  the host's thread and asks again only when its POLY is next switched on (no polling).
- **The copyright line** "Copyright © 2026 Idle Foundry Ltd." is in the README, the notices,
  the macOS bundles' Info.plist and the Windows installer (whose publisher is now Idle
  Foundry Ltd.).

**Evidence (2026-10-03, the Mac):** the plug-in's tests (`ca72-plugin`: the library's 72, among
them `an_instance_with_poly_off_leaves_its_workers_to_one_with_it_on` and
`the_workers_follow_poly_through_the_plug_ins_life`; the real-time test with POLY switched,
nothing allocated on the audio thread), `ca72`'s `threaded` and `rt_alloc`, rustfmt and
clippy (and clippy for Windows).

## R22. URW Gothic for the lettering
**Owner decision, 2026-10-03:** shown the panel lettered in TeX Gyre Adventor, URW Gothic and
Nimbus Sans side by side, the owner chose URW Gothic.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **Why change.** TeX Gyre Adventor's GUST Font License is the LaTeX Project Public
  License 1.3c, which the FSF counts as incompatible with the GNU GPL (some modified
  versions must carry, or point to, the unmodified original), and the plug-in builds its
  font into its binaries. URW Gothic, the font TeX Gyre Adventor was made from, is under the
  GNU AGPL 3.0 with a font exception; the GPL 3.0 (section 13) lets a work be combined with
  one under the AGPL 3.0, so the binaries are one work under compatible licences.
- **The same letters.** The drawn panel differs in 0.3 % of its pixels, at the letters'
  edges; the approved-image test gives a mean difference of 1.304 and a 99th percentile of
  28 (TeX Gyre Adventor's: 1.245 and 26; the limits 1.5 and 32). Book is the regular, Demi
  the bold.
- `third_party/urw-gothic/`: the two fonts unmodified, from
  `ArtifexSoftware/urw-base35-fonts` at tag `20200910`, with its licence, exception and
  readme, the hashes in `VENDORED.md`; the notices carry the licence and the exception.
  R2's "TeX Gyre Adventor" stands as the record of that time; `docs/panel.png` is drawn
  again.

## R23. The plug-in's own helper thread, so that a host may unload it at once
**Found 2026-10-03,** in the first CI run of the repository as published: on Windows,
clap-validator's `param-fuzz-modulation` test crashed (`0xc0000005`). On the Windows
reference machine it crashed in 167 of 200 runs with the code before R21 (workers started at
activation), and about once in 300 with R21.

**The cause (gdb).** The validator's main thread was unloading the plug-in's library while
nih-plug's shared background thread still ran a task of ours inside it (rebuilding the spare
voices, R18; starting or stopping POLY's workers, R21), the voice workers alive beside it.
nih-plug's background thread keeps the plug-in alive while it runs a task for it, so a host's
destroy during one returned at once and left the plug-in, its pools and their workers
running; Windows unmaps a library as soon as it is unloaded. macOS and Linux keep a library
mapped while threads of it live (on Linux, glibc's record of their thread-local
destructors), so only Windows crashed.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (not separately approved):
- **The plug-in gives nih-plug's background thread no work.** A helper thread of its own,
  `ca72-helper`, started at the first activation, rebuilds the spares and starts and stops
  POLY's workers; the audio thread asks it with an atomic and an unpark, allocating nothing
  and waiting for nothing. Dropping the plug-in stops and joins the helper, then the pools
  and their workers: when the host's destroy returns, no thread of the plug-in runs. A
  rebuild stops before its next voice when told to stop, so a destroy waits at most for one
  voice to be built.
- Linux's watchdog threads (R11, R18) still live for the process once started. glibc keeps
  the library loaded while they live, so a host's unload there is deferred, not a crash; left
  as it is.

**Evidence (2026-10-03):** on the Windows reference machine (the GNU toolchain), with the
helper: `param-fuzz-modulation` 0 crashes in 300 runs, and 0 in 100 runs of a build whose
helper was made to stall 1.5 s a round regardless of a stop (the worst case for a destroy;
those runs took about 1.5 s longer each, the destroy waiting); the full clap-validator, 36
passed, 0 failed. On the Linux reference machine: 0 failures in 100 runs, the full
clap-validator 37 passed, clippy, and the plug-in's tests on 16 processors and on 3 (as CI's).
On the Mac: the plug-in's tests (among them
`a_plug_in_dropped_while_its_helper_works_leaves_no_thread_running`), rustfmt and clippy, and
clippy for Windows. GitHub's CI could not run: the organisation's Actions minutes for private
repositories were spent.

## R24. 0.1.0's Windows and Linux installers built on the reference machines
**2026-10-03.** The tag's CI could not run (R23: the organisation's Actions minutes for
private repositories were spent), so the draft release had only the Mac's installer. The
owner chose to build the other two on the reference machines from the tagged commit rather
than make the repository public early for CI's free minutes.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-03** (the route approved by the owner, the means not separately):
- **Windows** with the GNU toolchain (Rust 1.97.1, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) and Inno Setup
  6.7.3: `cargo xtask bundle ca72-plugin --profile bundle`, then `scripts/package.sh`. The
  plug-in imports only Windows's own libraries (the universal C runtime among them, as on any
  Windows 10 or 11), none of MinGW's.
- **Linux** linked by Zig 0.17.0 through cargo-zigbuild 0.23.4 against glibc 2.35, the floor
  CI's Ubuntu 22.04 gives (the machine's own glibc, 2.43, would have raised it): the wrapper
  `cargo zigbuild --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.2.35` makes is given to the bundler as
  `CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER`, with `RUSTFLAGS="-L native=<dir>"` where
  `<dir>` holds links to the system's libX11, libX11-xcb and libxcb only, then
  `cargo xtask bundle ca72-plugin --profile bundle --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `scripts/package.sh`. The plug-in's newest glibc symbol is `GLIBC_2.35`; it needs libX11,
  libX11-xcb, libxcb, libm, libc and nothing else.
- CI stays the way releases are built; this was for 0.1.0 only.
- **The release job's checksums** now take CI's line for a file over the draft's earlier one,
  so a re-run that replaces an installer replaces its checksum too (before, `sort -u` kept
  the earlier line).

**Evidence.** Each installer was validated and installed on its system before it went into
the release, built from the release's tag: on Windows clap-validator and pluginval at
strictness 10 (editor tests skipped: no desktop over SSH; Steinberg's validator needs Visual
Studio), a silent install (the plug-ins in Common Files, the Apps entry "CA-72 0.1.0, Idle
Foundry Ltd."), clap-validator on the installed CLAP and a silent uninstall leaving nothing;
on Linux clap-validator, pluginval at strictness 10 (editor tests skipped) and Steinberg's
validator, and `install.sh` into an empty home. Their checksums are the release's
`SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## R25. The review before going public
**2026-10-04.** A last review of the repository and the release before it was made public
(the owner: "if not, give it one last review"), by two agents, one on the documents and one
on licensing and provenance, checked against the code. Nothing blocked; these were fixed.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-04** (not separately approved):
- **The Rust standard library's notice.** std, core, alloc and what the standard library
  bundles are linked into every Rust binary, under MIT or Apache-2.0; the notices now carry
  the Rust project's MIT notice, for the Rust that `rust-toolchain.toml` names.
- **The sources of the crates taken from git.** Cargo.lock takes seven sources from git
  repositories of others (vst3-sys, GPL-3.0, among them, from a branch), which could vanish;
  the rest are on crates.io, which keeps every version. `scripts/git-sources.sh` packs the
  seven at their pinned commits into `CA-72-<version>-git-sources.tar.gz`, which the release
  job puts into each release (0.1.0's was made on the Mac the same way); the notices say so
  and give each git crate's repository and commit.
- **Credits:** the fonts' own copyright line and the licence they are built in under (the
  AGPL 3.0, R22) in the notices; `circuits/models/ua741.lib` credits TI's PSpice uA741
  macromodel, whose layout it follows (its values are computed from the data sheet); the
  trademark notice names Moog as well.
- **Documents:** the README's install steps for Linux, uninstalling on each system, building
  universal bundles (the two targets to add), the voice POLY takes ("the oldest of those let
  go", as the code does, not the one released longest ago); a sentence about the DAW the
  model came from removed; CONTRIBUTING's commands as CI runs them, and the preset
  comparison's procedure; SECURITY's link; `docs/macos-release.md` written as a maintainer's
  procedure rather than one machine's notes; two crates' descriptions; the ngspice version
  Homebrew must have. R17's "some 190 crates" was too many: the notices list 159.
- **0.1.0 rebuilt.** The notices are inside every installer, so 0.1.0's three installers were
  built again from the corrected tree, and the tag v0.1.0, not yet public, moved to it.

## R26. Windows: the host no longer aborts as the presets' drawer opens
**The report, 2026-10-05.** A developer tried the VST3 on Windows 11 in Sonar and in a DAW of
their own: it loaded, but opening the presets' drawer ended the host. Their recording, in Sonar:
the window grows for the drawer, the new part stays white, and some 7 s later Sonar is gone,
with no dialog.

**The cause,** found on the Windows reference machine with 0.1.0's released VST3 (its
installer checked against `SHA256SUMS.txt`) in a test host written for it, which answers
`IPlugFrame::resizeView` in several ways. baseview borrows the editor's window handler (a
`RefCell`) for each event; a `WM_SIZE` that reached the window while the handler was still
handling the press borrowed it again: a panic inside the window procedure, which cannot
unwind, so the process aborted (exception 0xC0000409, fail fast; Windows Error Reporting
names `CA-72.vst3`). Two ways led there:
- **The drawer taking the keyboard.** The press asked the host to grow the window and baseview
  to follow (a deferred task); `take_keys` then called baseview's `focus()`, `SetFocus`, whose
  focus messages reached the window from within the handler, and baseview ran its deferred
  tasks for them: the resize, and so the `WM_SIZE`. Only where the editor's window did not
  already have the keyboard: REAPER 7.82 gives a plug-in's window the keyboard as it is
  clicked, and its drawer opened and shut normally (with real clicks, three launches).
- **A host resizing the editor's window from within `resizeView`.** Then the `WM_SIZE` came
  from the host, whatever had the keyboard. The grip, which asks from the editor's frame, did
  the same in such a host.

The test host aborted 3 times in 3 for each host behaviour that agrees to the resize (five
behaviours, with and without the processing active, posted and real clicks), and never where
the host refused it (the drawer then opens over the panel). Which way Sonar takes was not
seen (it needs an account the owner does not have); the symptoms and the second DAW fit
either. The same panic was fixed upstream for `focus()` alone
([baseview#252](https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview/pull/252), 2026-05-25), after the
revision the editor took.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-05** (the owner approved making the fix and asked that both ways
work; not separately approved otherwise):
- **baseview vendored and patched** in `third_party/baseview`, at the commit the editor took
  from git, as nih-plug is (`third_party/baseview/PATCHES.md`): an event that arrives while
  the handler is busy waits and is given to it once its call returns, the deferred tasks run
  only then, and `focus()` is deferred (#252). Not upstream's master: its Windows backend and
  handler interface were rewritten, a port of the editor. Not #252 alone: it leaves the second
  way (the tests below abort with it alone). A review of the patch (a second agent) found that
  closing the window freed its state while baseview's window procedure still read it (as
  upstream did); each call of it now keeps the state until it returns.
- **Tests in a real window** (Windows only, `editor.rs`, `windows_window_tests`): the editor's
  window in a window of the test's, off the screen, in a host that grows its own window, or
  resizes the editor's as well from within the request: the drawer opens below the strip and
  shuts, and the grip resizes. They aborted the test process before the patch. The test's
  window has no taskbar button and is not brought to the front, and the tests count in pixels
  whatever the screen's scale (each thread per-monitor aware). The editor's window now takes its
  presets' library from its caller, so that these tests read an empty folder of theirs rather
  than the user's.
- **The git sources.** baseview at 9a0b42c is no longer taken from git, so
  `CA-72-<version>-git-sources.tar.gz` leaves it out (it is in this repository);
  nih-plug's standalone still takes baseview at 579130e from git. The notices name its
  repository.

**Evidence (2026-10-05, the Windows reference machine, the GNU toolchain as R24, a screen
at 200 %):** the bundle as it ships (`--profile bundle`) in the test host: the drawer opened
under nine conditions, and opened, took the keyboard, shut and reopened under seven host
behaviours; the grip resized under three (0.1.0 aborted under two of them); the editor
opened, closed and opened again; no abort, panic or error report in any. Before the review's
changes the patch had passed the same, the drawer runs 3 times in 3 each. In REAPER 7.82 (the
bundle loaded from its own folder) the drawer opened below the strip with real clicks, three
launches. `windows_window_tests` 3 passed; each aborted with baseview's Windows files as
upstream had them, and the two where the host resizes the editor's window aborted with #252's
change alone. `cargo test --workspace`: 217 passed, 0 failed (22 ignored, run by hand).
Clippy with `-D warnings` on the workspace, all targets, with
`--features ca72-plugin/standalone` (`assert_process_allocs` does not build for the GNU
target; CI's `--all-features` on MSVC not run here); `cargo fmt --all -- --check`;
`scripts/notices.py --check`. Not tried: Sonar, the reporter's DAW, the CLAP in a host (the
same editor), macOS and Linux (whose code is unchanged: `src/macos/window.rs` only as rustfmt
orders it).

## R27. An update check, when asked
**Owner decisions, 2026-10-06.** The owner asked whether the plug-in could look for new
releases on GitHub, or let its user look. Of three ways offered (a link to the releases'
page; a check made when the user clicks; a check made by itself, at most daily, that could
be turned off), the owner chose the second, with a button that downloads the installer for
the user's system. Installing it from within the plug-in was weighed and not made: the
plug-in would be replacing its own files while the host has them loaded (locked, on
Windows), both installers ask for an administrator anyway, and a plug-in that ran what it
downloaded would let whoever controlled a release run code on every user's machine (the
Windows installer is unsigned, and the release's checksums come from the same release).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):
- **Where:** the presets' drawer's tools, before ×: the version (`CA-72 0.1.0`) and CHECK FOR
  UPDATES. The strip's row is full (R12), and the panel is the instrument's.
- **Through the system's curl,** not a network library linked in: Windows' own
  `System32\curl.exe` (Windows 10 1803 on), macOS's `/usr/bin/curl`, elsewhere the one on the
  path. It asks `api.github.com/repos/idlefoundry/ca-72/releases/latest`, which names only
  published releases (no drafts or pre-releases): HTTPS only (redirects too), 20 s and 1 MB at
  most, as `CA-72/<version>`, nothing else sent; on Windows without a console window.
  serde_json, which nih-plug already links, reads the answer: the notices are unchanged.
- **No thread waits for it** (R23): curl writes into a file the editor makes afresh in the
  temporary folder (never one already there, nor through a link), and the editor looks each
  frame whether curl has finished. Closing the editor ends curl and removes the file; past
  30 s the check fails. A curl gone with its exit unknown (a host that reaps its children
  itself, ignoring SIGCHLD) has its answer read all the same and judged by itself; curl
  writes none on an HTTP error.
- **What it shows:** CHECKING…; `<version> IS UP TO DATE` (this release or a later one) and
  CHECK FOR UPDATES again; `<new> IS OUT (THIS IS <this>)` in the accent, and DOWNLOAD; after
  DOWNLOAD, CLOSE THE DAW, THEN INSTALL IT; COULD NOT CHECK (no curl, no answer, an HTTP
  error, an answer without a version) and RELEASES PAGE; NO BROWSER WOULD OPEN. A version is
  three numbers, compared in order.
- **DOWNLOAD opens the installer in the browser,** which downloads it: the release's
  `CA-72-<version>-Windows-setup.exe`, `-macOS.pkg` or `-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, as the README
  lists them; the release's page where it has none for the system, or the system has none
  (Linux on ARM). Windows' shell (`ShellExecuteW`) opens it, macOS's `open`, Linux's
  `xdg-open`, and only an address under `https://github.com/idlefoundry/ca-72/releases`,
  whatever the answer says. An `open` or `xdg-open` that exits in failure (with no display,
  `xdg-open` exits 3 and opens nothing) turns the message to NO BROWSER WOULD OPEN.
- **SECURITY.md** no longer says the plug-in opens no network connections: it says when it
  connects and what it sends. The README says how to update, and the check's limits (curl,
  no Windows proxy settings).
- **Tests:** `update::tests` (versions; each system's installer found; addresses elsewhere
  refused; answers without a version; every scene fits the drawer whole; a newer release's
  DOWNLOAD and what follows, and this release up to date and checked again, each through a
  stand-in for curl printing a canned answer; curl missing or failing; an opener failing
  once started; the editor closed mid-check ending curl at once and leaving no file; and,
  run by hand, GitHub asked, the releases' page opened in the browser, and the latest
  release's installer for the system downloaded by it), `ca72-panel`'s `presets::tests`
  (the button found where drawn, and not where there is none), and the editor's
  `the_drawer_checks_for_updates`.

**Evidence (2026-10-06):** on Windows 11 (the GNU toolchain as R24), macOS (the Mac, Apple
silicon) and Linux (an x86-64 desktop running Hyprland), the tests of `ca72-plugin` and
`ca72-panel` all passed, R26's real-window tests among them on Windows, and clippy with
`-D warnings` passed on both crates and all targets (on Windows the whole workspace with
`--features ca72-plugin/standalone`); `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and
`scripts/notices.py --check` on Windows. On each system, by hand, the system's own curl
found 0.1.0 up to date, and the browser (Chrome on Windows and macOS, Chromium on Linux)
opened the releases' page and downloaded 0.1.0's installer for the system, its SHA-256 the
release's `SHA256SUMS.txt` gives (the `.pkg` signed and notarised). A build calling itself
0.0.9, so that 0.1.0 was newer:
- **REAPER 7.79 on Linux** (a portable copy scanning only the build's folder; the clicks
  sent to the editor's X11 window): the drawer opened below the strip, the window growing;
  CHECK FOR UPDATES, then CHECKING…, then `0.1.0 IS OUT (THIS IS 0.0.9)` and DOWNLOAD;
  DOWNLOAD had Chromium download the Linux installer (its SHA-256 the release's) and said
  CLOSE THE DAW, THEN INSTALL IT; no process of the check's was left, nor its file.
- **The standalone on Windows** (started without a console, as a host is; the clicks posted
  to the editor's window; a screen at 200 %): the same, `System32\curl.exe` run by it with
  the arguments above, no console window appearing, its file removed; DOWNLOAD had Chrome
  download the Windows installer (15,419,949 bytes, the release's); closed, it exited.

Later the same day, the build calling itself 0.0.9 renamed `CA-72 TEST` (its own CLAP and VST3
IDs, so that a host never takes it for the installed CA-72), in portable copies of REAPER 7.82
that kept their settings to themselves:
- **On macOS** (the VST3; the clicks made with `cliclick`): the same, from CHECK FOR UPDATES to
  `CLOSE THE DAW, THEN INSTALL IT`; Chrome downloaded the `.pkg` (its SHA-256 the release's).
- **On Windows** (the CLAP, then the VST3; the clicks posted to the editor's window): the same;
  `System32\curl.exe` run by REAPER, no console window, the file removed; Chrome downloaded the
  Windows installer (the release's size).

Seen meanwhile, and not this record's: on Windows the editor does not draw again when Windows
repaints its window, so whatever invalidates it (a capture made with `PrintWindow` here) leaves
it blank until something in it changes; 0.1.0 did the same. Left for a change of its own (R28).

Not tried: Live or Bitwig, an HTTP proxy, a release whose installer is missing.

## R28. Windows: the editor shown again when Windows repaints its window
**Seen, 2026-10-06,** while the update check was tried (R27) in REAPER 7.82 on Windows 11 (a
screen at 200 %): with 0.1.0's released VST3 in a floating FX window, the editor's area on the
screen had 872 distinct colours (64 by 64 samples); right after `PrintWindow(FX window,
PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)` it had 2, and still 2 three seconds later, the panel gone for RGB 240,
240, 240. A test build of the update check's branch did the same.

**The cause.** The editor shows a frame only when it has changed (R5), and on Linux again
every 250 ms (R19, which took macOS and Windows to keep a window's pixels). Windows does not
always: whatever invalidates a window (a host repainting its own, a capture with
`PrintWindow`, some remote-desktop and capture tools) has Windows ask for it to be painted
(`WM_PAINT`), and a parent window without `WS_CLIPCHILDREN`, as a dialog may be, paints its
background over its children first. baseview left `WM_PAINT` to `DefWindowProcW`, which
validates the window without drawing, and told the editor nothing; the editor's window
class has no background of its own, so what showed was the parent's. 240, 240, 240 is a
dialog's (`COLOR_BTNFACE`). In a test host whose window is such a dialog, the editor's
window was left that one colour when the host's window was repainted with its children, and
when the host's window was captured with `PrintWindow`, 1.1 s later still; repainting the
editor's window alone changed nothing (no background to paint). In REAPER the editor's
window is in REAPER's `reaperPluginHostWrapProc`, in a dialog in the FX window's dialog
(`#32770`): none of the three has `WS_CLIPCHILDREN`.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (the owner asked for the fix and its test; not separately
approved otherwise):
- **baseview tells the handler,** a second patch in `third_party/baseview` (PATCHES.md):
  `WM_PAINT` gives the handler a new event, `WindowEvent::Damaged`, as R26 gives any event
  (queued while the handler is busy, given once its call returns, never a second borrow from
  within the window procedure), and `DefWindowProcW` then validates what the handler has not
  drawn, or Windows would ask again ahead of every frame's timer. Upstream's rewritten master
  does the same since [baseview#344](https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview/pull/344)
  (2026-10-04): it tells its handler of the damage and draws within `WM_PAINT`; its
  interface is not this revision's (R26).
- **The editor shows its last frame again at once** on that event: a copy, nothing rendered
  (as R19's on Linux), only when Windows asks; no frame more otherwise. Not before a first
  frame since the window opened or resized (that frame is due anyway). softbuffer validates
  the window as it presents, so Windows does not ask again.
- **Not at the next frame instead** (the frame marked unshown, for `on_frame` to show): the
  parent's background would show for up to a frame's 15 ms at each repaint.
- **Linux and macOS unchanged.** baseview's X11 backend ignores `Expose`, so R19's repaint
  stays; macOS keeps a window's pixels.
- **The test,** in `windows_window_tests`: `the_panel_is_shown_again_as_windows_repaints_its_window`.
  R26's host window could not show this: nothing is kept of what is drawn off the screen (a
  window's pixels there are clipped away, so there is nothing to read), and it clips its
  children from its painting. This test's host window is a dialog's (its class's background
  `COLOR_BTNFACE`, no `WS_CLIPCHILDREN`), on the screen at its top left, but at an alpha of 1
  in 255, at the bottom of the windows, letting the pointer through to whatever is under it
  (`WS_EX_LAYERED`, `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`), with no taskbar button and never activated, as
  R26's. The editor's pixels are read with `GetPixel`, 64 by 64 (the window's own, whatever
  covers it). The test checks that the host's window repainted alone covers the editor's
  window here (one colour), that the panel's pixels are back, the same, within 100 ms of the
  host's window repainted with its children (`RedrawWindow`, `RDW_INVALIDATE | RDW_ERASE |
  RDW_UPDATENOW | RDW_ALLCHILDREN`) and of `PrintWindow(host's window,
  PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)`; and, with the drawer opened below the strip in a host that repaints
  its windows from within the editor's request (a `WM_PAINT` reaching the editor while its
  handler is busy), that the panel and the drawer are back after a repaint.

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Windows reference machine, the GNU toolchain as R24, a screen at
200 %):** with the `WM_PAINT` event never given (baseview as before this record), the test
failed 3 times in 3, the editor's window one colour after the host's was repainted, and
`PrintWindow` on the host's window alone (a check of its own, run by hand) left 0xF0F0F0
there, still 1.1 s later. With the patch, the panel's 632 colours (of 64 by 64 samples) came
back each time, `PrintWindow` alone left them as they were (3 runs in 3), and a probe saw a
`WM_PAINT` reach the editor while its handler was busy, as the drawer opened, with no abort.
`windows_window_tests` 4 passed in each of 9 runs; the plug-in's tests
(`cargo test -p ca72-plugin`) 102 passed, 0 failed (8 ignored, run by hand). Clippy with
`-D warnings` on the workspace, all targets, with `--features ca72-plugin/standalone`;
`cargo fmt --all -- --check` (on a copy of the tree outside the main checkout, which this one
was nested in); `scripts/notices.py --check`.

In REAPER 7.82, a copy of it with a resource folder of its own each run (`-cfgfile`), its
first-run questions answered No (importing the license key it found on the clipboard,
choosing an audio device), and a script putting the VST3 on a track, its FX window floating;
then, as in the report, the editor sampled 64 by 64 (on the screen and from its own window),
`PrintWindow(FX window, PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)`, the editor sampled at once and 3 s later, then
the same for `RedrawWindow(FX window, RDW_INVALIDATE | RDW_ERASE | RDW_UPDATENOW |
RDW_ALLCHILDREN)`:
- **0.1.0** (the installed VST3, as REAPER loaded it): 331 colours before; one, 240, 240, 240,
  at once after the capture and 3 s later, and after the repaint (2 runs).
- **This change,** built as the bundle is (`--profile bundle`) under a name and IDs of its own
  (`CA-72 R28`, as R27's `CA-72 TEST`), the file it loaded checked: REAPER scans the standard
  VST3 folders whatever its settings say, and took the installed 0.1.0, of the same name and
  IDs, over a build of this change named as it is. 331 colours before and after both, 3 runs
  in 3; in two, the screen where the editor is was the same image, byte for byte, before,
  after the capture and after the repaint (in the third, REAPER's About window had come over
  part of it on the screen; the editor's own pixels kept their 331 colours). `cargo xtask
  bundle`, run in a worktree inside another checkout, builds the outer one (nih-plug's xtask
  goes to the outermost folder with a `Cargo.lock`), so the build was `cargo build --profile
  bundle` here.

Not tried: another host, a remote-desktop session, CI's Windows runner (the new test needs
the editor drawn on a desktop), macOS and Linux (whose code is unchanged).

## R29. 0.1.1
**Owner decision, 2026-10-06.** A 0.1.1 release once R28 is merged ("once #4 merges,
prepare a 0.1.1 release").

**What it brings since 0.1.0** (the tag `v0.1.0`):
- **Windows: the host no longer aborts** as the presets' drawer opens, nor as the grip
  resizes in a host that resizes the editor's window from within the editor's request (R26;
  Sonar, and a developer's own DAW).
- **Windows: the editor is shown again when Windows repaints its window** (R28; it stayed
  the host's grey after a capture or a host's repaint, in REAPER among others).
- **CHECK FOR UPDATES** in the presets' drawer (R27). 0.1.0 has none, so its users learn of
  0.1.1 from the releases page.
- The README's video (documents only).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):
- **A patch release, 0.1.1.** Nothing a project or a preset holds has changed since 0.1.0:
  the parameters, the plug-in's IDs, the voice (`crates/ca72`, the plug-in's engine) and the
  presets' format are 0.1.0's, so what was saved with 0.1.0 opens unchanged. Its installers
  install over 0.1.0's, as they are made to (the Windows installer's AppId is 0.1.0's, the
  macOS packages are not version-checked, `install.sh` replaces the bundles).
- **The version** is the workspace's (`Cargo.toml`): every crate's, so the installers'
  names, the macOS packages' versions, the Windows installer's Apps entry and the update
  check's own version (`CARGO_PKG_VERSION`) follow; `Cargo.lock` changed only in the
  workspace's eight crates. The README's status names 0.1.1.
- **The update check's test of versions** (`a_version_is_three_numbers`, R27) took 0.1.1 to
  be newer than this build, true only of 0.1.0, and failed with the bump: it now takes the
  next patch, minor and major of this build's version to be newer, and neither this one nor
  0.1.0, so that a release's version leaves it passing.
- **Released the way R17 and R20 set out** (R24 was 0.1.0's exception): once this is
  merged, the tag `v0.1.1` on main's commit; CI's release job drafts the release with the
  Windows and Linux installers, the notices, the git sources and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the macOS
  installer is built, signed and notarised on the Mac (`docs/macos-release.md`) and put into
  the draft; the owner publishes it, with notes in 0.1.0's form (drafted in this change's
  pull request).

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Windows reference machine, the GNU toolchain as R24),** on this
change's tree (R28's, main merged into it, and the bump): `cargo test --workspace` 229
passed, 0 failed (25 ignored, run by hand); clippy with `-D warnings` on the workspace, all
targets, with `--features ca72-plugin/standalone`; `cargo fmt --all -- --check`;
`scripts/notices.py --check`. `cargo xtask bundle ca72-plugin --profile bundle` and
`scripts/package.sh` made `CA-72-0.1.1-Windows-setup.exe`, its version information 0.1.1, the
plug-in in it built from this tree (not installed: the machine's 0.1.0 is left as it is). The
macOS and Linux installers are CI's, on the pull request.

**The release (2026-10-06, the release Mac: an M4 Pro, macOS 27.0, Xcode 27.0, notarytool
1.1.3),** from a fresh clone of the tag `v0.1.1` (`425af615`, main's commit; clean, version
0.1.1). The tag's CI passed and drafted the release with its five assets. `cargo xtask
bundle-universal ca72-plugin --profile bundle` (Rust 1.97.1) made the bundles, then
`scripts/package.sh` with the two Developer ID identities, the notary profile and
`CA72_REQUIRE_NOTARIZATION=1` made `CA-72-0.1.1-macOS.pkg`:
- **Apple's notary service** accepted it: submission `d2746af0-c27b-4fee-9a99-5705a755bd6a`,
  status `Accepted`. The ticket is stapled (`stapler validate` passes); the installer is
  signed `Developer ID Installer: Idle Foundry Ltd. (3JA8JUZ36W)`, trusted timestamp
  2026-10-06 16:18:47 UTC; Gatekeeper (`spctl --assess --type install`): `accepted`,
  `source=Notarized Developer ID`.
- **The VST3 and the CLAP in its payload** (expanded with `pkgutil --expand-full`): each
  signed `Developer ID Application: Idle Foundry Ltd. (3JA8JUZ36W)` with the hardened
  runtime and a secure timestamp, `codesign --verify --strict` passing; version 0.1.1
  (nih-plug's bundler writes 1.0.0, `package.sh` the workspace's); `x86_64 arm64`; LICENSE
  and the notices inside; installed to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` and `…/CLAP`.
- **Its SHA-256** is `f0077b6b74ab10d0c66271b921de7390f5b6f282c963c3a388ada181b38a5624`
  (9,189,503 bytes). It went into the draft with its line added to CI's `SHA256SUMS.txt`;
  the four files it lists, downloaded again from the draft, passed `shasum -a 256 -c`.
- **Published** on the owner's word at 2026-10-06 16:22:13 UTC as the latest release
  (https://github.com/idlefoundry/ca-72/releases/tag/v0.1.1, six assets). The API's
  `releases/latest`, which CHECK FOR UPDATES reads, gives `v0.1.1`; the `.pkg` downloaded
  from the public release matches its checksum and Gatekeeper accepts it.

`notarization.json` is kept with the release's evidence outside the repository.

## R30. An Audio Unit for macOS
**Owner decision, 2026-10-06.** An Audio Unit, as asked for in issue #6 ("an AU-Plugin
version"): "start the AU work on a branch, you can use GarageBand for testing on this
computer. When we've determined that everything works, please merge into main and clean up
the branch." Made alongside another machine's work on Potato's speed: the Audio Unit wraps
the CLAP plug-in as it is, so the two meet only in the plug-in's parameters, its state and
its latency, which the wrapper passes on unchanged, and in this file.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):
- **Version 2, made from the CLAP plug-in by clap-wrapper.** nih-plug makes no Audio Units.
  [clap-wrapper](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-wrapper)'s AUv2 wrapper (MIT; v0.16.0,
  its latest) presents the CLAP plug-in to the host as an Audio Unit: the plug-in's own code
  is unchanged, and the Audio Unit plays what the CLAP plays. Version 2 rather than 3: Logic
  Pro and GarageBand, and every macOS host that takes Audio Units, load version 2 in their
  own process; version 3 is an app extension inside an app of its own, and what iPad hosts
  need, which the CA-72 is not built for.
- **The CLAP inside the component** (`Contents/PlugIns/CA-72.clap`). The wrapper looks
  there before the CLAP folders, so the component plays the CLAP it was built with, whether
  or not a CLAP is installed, and never another version that happens to be. The installer's
  component carries the same signed CLAP as its CLAP choice (`scripts/package.sh` signs the
  CLAP, then copies it in, then signs the component). It costs the component the CLAP's
  10 MB.
- **Its identity, which a host keeps in its songs and so must never change:** type `aumu`
  (an instrument), subtype `CA72`, manufacturer `IdlF` (Idle Foundry; Apple keeps the
  all-lowercase codes for itself); the name "Idle Foundry: CA-72" (Logic and GarageBand list
  it as CA-72 under Idle Foundry); the bundle identifier `com.idlefoundry.ca-72.component`.
- **Vendored:** clap-wrapper, the CLAP headers (1.2.6) and Apple's AudioUnitSDK (1.1.0, the
  Apache License 2.0), at the versions clap-wrapper fetches for itself, in `third_party/`
  with their sources' commits and hashes (`PATCHES.md`, `VENDORED.md`). The build needs no
  network, and the source of everything built into the component is in the repository, as
  the GPL asks of the whole. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` carries their licences, and {fmt}'s,
  which clap-wrapper compiles in (`scripts/notices.py`).
- **clap-wrapper patched** (`third_party/clap-wrapper/PATCHES.md`): pluginval aborted the
  host in about one run in four with the heap corrupted, because the host's parameter
  changes went straight into the audio thread's event list from whatever thread the host
  called on; and a state saved before the host rendered a block lost the changes since the
  last one, and the host read the values from before a state it had just restored. Four
  changes: the host's changes wait under a lock for the audio thread; a save hands any
  still waiting to the plug-in first (`clap_plugin_params.flush()`, with no block
  processed meanwhile); a restore refreshes the values the host reads at once; and the
  host lists the parameters in the plug-in's order, the panel's, rather than by id.
  Nothing upstream had reported or fixed them; offering the fixes upstream is the owner's
  call.
- **Built by `scripts/auv2.sh`** (CMake 3.21 or later; `scripts/auv2/CMakeLists.txt`), from
  `target/bundled/CA-72.clap`, after the bundles, for the CLAP's architectures (universal
  for a release) and for macOS 11 as they are. Afresh each time, a few seconds: the wrapper
  reads the CLAP while it builds, which CMake does not track.
- **In the macOS installer** as a third choice, Audio Unit, into
  `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`, like the others not relocatable and not version
  checked.
- **Validated** by `scripts/validate.sh` on macOS: Apple's `auval -strict` (and the Intel
  slice under Rosetta, where it is installed) and pluginval at strictness 10. Hosts and these
  validators find an Audio Unit only where it is installed, so the script first copies it
  into `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`, over any copy there. CI builds it on macOS,
  validates it and keeps it with the bundles.
- **Not released here.** The README says that the Audio Unit comes with the macOS installer
  from the release after 0.1.1; until then it is built from source.

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the release Mac: an M4 Pro, macOS 27.0, Xcode 27.0, CMake 4.4.4,
Rust 1.97.1),** on this change's tree. `scripts/auv2.sh` on the universal bundles made
`CA-72.component`, `x86_64 arm64`.
- **`auval -strict`:** AU VALIDATION SUCCEEDED: 51 parameters (in the panel's order with
  change 4), the Cocoa view, renders from 11.025 to 192 kHz and 64 to 4096 frames, MIDI.
  One warning: the preset's name is not kept in the class data. The Intel slice was not
  run: this Mac has no Rosetta.
- **pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10** (editor tests skipped, the screen in use). With
  clap-wrapper as released it aborted the host in 2 runs of 10 ("BUG IN CLIENT OF
  LIBMALLOC: memory corruption of free block": the message thread in `SetParameter()` while
  another thread initialized the unit), where the VST3 passed 5 of 5. With change 1, no abort
  in 12 runs, and with changes 1 and 2 none in 20, but the state restoration test failed in
  1 and 3 of them; with all four, 24 of 24 passed, and the seeds that had failed pass.
- **A host of AVAudioEngine's,** the way GarageBand and Logic load units: five notes sound
  (RMS 0.13), the output bounded; the full state, saved after a block, restored into a
  second instance; parameters set and saved with no block between are kept (clap-wrapper as
  released loses them). The editor through `kAudioUnitProperty_CocoaUI`, opened and closed
  four times and the unit disposed of with it open; and through Apple's out-of-process
  hosting (`AUHostingService`), drawn whole at 1382 by 463.
- **GarageBand 10.4.14,** which on this macOS loads the component in Apple's hosting
  service: listed under AU Instruments › Idle Foundry › CA-72 (Stereo); its Smart Controls
  took the first parameters in the panel's order; the editor shown whole in its plug-in
  window. Four notes recorded with Musical Typing and exported as WAVE: 0.15 RMS, the C at
  260 Hz (C4, 261.6 Hz), released to silence. POLY on and VOICES 5, set on the panel; the
  project saved, closed and reopened with both as set; played back with POLY on, no crash.
- **`scripts/package.sh`** (signed ad hoc here) made a three-choice installer, every package
  not relocatable, the component's CLAP identical to the CLAP choice's;
  `scripts/notices.py --check` passes. CI's runs are on the pull request.

## R31. Hosts that switch the side chain off: the plug-in no longer reads address 0
**The report, 2026-10-06.** Users told the owner that the CA-72 did not work in Sandyne, a
free DAW, as a VST on Windows. The owner asked for it to be tried there.

**The cause,** found on the Windows reference machine with Sandyne 2.5.0.0 (its installer,
`Sandyne_v2.5.0.0_win64.exe`, 538,577,168 bytes, from the link on sandyne.com, installed by
the owner; it takes VST3 and CLAP) and 0.1.1's released VST3 (its installer checked against
`SHA256SUMS.txt`; the module Sandyne loaded was that file, 4,636,160 bytes, version 0.1.1).
Sandyne scanned the plug-in without trouble. Put on a track, it was set up for blocks of up
to 1920 samples at 48 kHz, its editor opened, and in its first block, of 480 samples, Sandyne
caught an access violation inside the plug-in's processing and disabled it for the session
("Plugin Crashed: CA-72"): no sound. Sandyne is built with JUCE, and sets an instrument up
with outputs only (`setPlayConfigDetails (maxBs=1920 outCh=2)` in its log), which switches
off the CA-72's one input bus, its side chain (EXTERNAL INPUT). For a bus switched off on its
side, JUCE's VST3 hosting gives the bus's full channel count, two, with every channel's
pointer null (`HostBufferMapper::associateBufferTo`, `juce_VST3Common.h`). nih-plug checked
only that the array of pointers was not null, then copied each channel through its pointer:
a read from address 0. 0.1.0 does the same; the code is unchanged since. REAPER, where the
plug-in has been tried most, gives the bus its buffers. Hosts built with JUCE that set an
instrument up without inputs likely all meet it. That Sandyne switches the bus off is
inferred from its log and JUCE's source (Sandyne's is not public); the fix below, which
handles nothing else, ended the crash.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (the owner asked for the fix and for it to be tried in
Sandyne again; not separately approved otherwise):
- **nih-plug's ninth change** (`third_party/nih-plug/PATCHES.md`): a channel the host gives as
  a null pointer is read as silence if it is an input, and backed by scratch storage,
  discarded, if it is an output, so that every channel the plug-in sees is as long as the
  block. In the buffers both of nih-plug's wrappers share, so the CLAP takes it too, and with
  it the Audio Unit, which wraps the CLAP (R30). Not by the bus's activation
  (`IComponent::activateBus`), which nih-plug accepts and ignores: the pointers are what is
  read, and a host may give a null one for a bus it left active.
- **Tests.** `a_vst3_host_that_deactivates_the_side_chain_has_its_blocks_played`
  (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/lib.rs`) drives the plug-in's VST3 wrapper as Sandyne did: set up
  for 1920 samples, the side chain switched off, three blocks of 480 with its two channels
  null; every output sample written and finite. nih-plug's own `null_channel_pointers`
  covers each kind of channel, main and auxiliary, input and output; nih-plug's tests are
  not the workspace's, so it is run by hand, from a copy of `third_party/nih-plug` outside
  the repository (which keeps a `Cargo.lock` of its own out of it).
- **Tried in Sandyne under a name and IDs of its own,** as R28 was: `CA-72 R30` (so named
  before the Audio Unit took R30), built as the bundle is (`--profile bundle`, with MSVC as CI
  builds it: R32), in the user's VST3 and CLAP folders (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common`).
  R27's `CA-72 TEST` builds, still there, went to the Recycle Bin, so that Sandyne listed no
  stale build.

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Windows reference machine: i5-13600K, Windows 11, a screen at
200 %; Rust 1.97.1, GNU as R24 and MSVC as R32):**
- **Sandyne 2.5.0.0** (the owner's clicks, its log and the modules it loaded read here):
  0.1.1's VST3 crashed in its first block as above. This change's: scanned and put on a
  track, set up and set up again after its editor opened, as before; the editor at 3072 by
  1030, then 1536 by 515; the owner played notes on its track (four in Sandyne's log) and
  heard it play; no crash, no error in the log. Not tried: the CLAP in Sandyne, the drawer
  and the grip there, a project saved and opened again, other hosts built with JUCE.
- **The new test** aborted before the change, at the side chain's copy (a debug build checks
  the null pointer: `slice::from_raw_parts_mut requires the pointer to be aligned and
  non-null`; a release build reads address 0), and passes after it. nih-plug's buffer tests,
  `buffer_io` and `null_channel_pointers`, pass.
- **On this change's tree** (main with the Audio Unit, R30): `cargo test --workspace` 230
  passed, 0 failed (25 ignored, run by hand) with GNU, and the same with MSVC; clippy with
  `-D warnings` on the workspace and all targets, with `--features ca72-plugin/standalone`
  (GNU) and with `--all-features` (MSVC, as CI); `cargo fmt --all -- --check`;
  `scripts/notices.py --check`. macOS and Linux run the same code (CI's tests on the pull
  request); the Audio Unit was not tried.

## R32. Windows: the C runtime linked into the plug-in
**Seen, 2026-10-06,** while R31 was looked into: 0.1.1's Windows plug-in, built by CI with
MSVC, imports Visual C++'s runtime, `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, and four of the Universal C
Runtime's `api-ms-win-crt-*` libraries. The installer does not bring Visual C++'s runtime,
so where no other program has installed it and the host has no copy of its own, Windows
cannot load the plug-in, and the host shows it failing or not at all. Not seen on a
computer: read from the imports. Not R31's cause: Sandyne has its own copy, beside its
executable. The reference machine's builds, with GNU, never needed it.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (the owner asked for what was found on the way to be fixed,
and approved Visual Studio's Build Tools on the reference machine; not separately approved
otherwise):
- **The C runtime linked statically with MSVC** (`.cargo/config.toml`: `+crt-static` for
  `cfg(all(windows, target_env = "msvc"))`, which CI's Windows build is): the plug-in
  imports Windows' own libraries only. Not Visual C++'s redistributable in the installer
  (some 25 MB beside its 3.6, and a second program installed), nor the runtime's DLL beside
  the plug-in, where Windows does not look (it looks beside the host's executable). A
  `RUSTFLAGS` in the environment would replace the configuration's; CI sets none.
- **MSVC on the reference machine,** beside the GNU toolchain, which stays its default:
  Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (17.14, the C++ workload) and Rust 1.97.1 for
  `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (`cargo +1.97.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). The bundles as CI
  builds them, and its clippy with `--all-features` (R26 could not run it), run here now.

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Windows reference machine):** `cargo +1.97.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
xtask bundle ca72-plugin --profile bundle`: the VST3 and the CLAP import
`api-ms-win-core-synch-l1-2-0`, `avrt`, `bcryptprimitives`, `gdi32`, `kernel32`, `ntdll`,
`ole32`, `oleaut32`, `shell32` and `user32`, all Windows'; 0.1.1's VST3 imports these and
`VCRUNTIME140` and `api-ms-win-crt-heap`, `-math`, `-runtime` and `-string`. The exports are
0.1.1's (`GetPluginFactory`, `InitDll`, `ExitDll`, `clap_entry`); the VST3 is 4,802,048
bytes, 0.1.1's 4,636,160. R31's test build, linked the same way, played in Sandyne; the
workspace's tests pass with MSVC (R31). Not tried: a computer without Visual C++'s
redistributable (this one has had it since 2026-09-18), so the failure itself was not seen.

## R33. 0.1.2
**Owner decision, 2026-10-06.** A release as soon as may be, with R31 and the Audio Unit
(R30): "I would like to get this out as a release as soon as possible along with the AU pr,
as I think people might be running into issues."

**What it brings since 0.1.1** (the tag `v0.1.1`):
- **The plug-in plays in hosts that switch its side chain off** (R31): in Sandyne, and
  likely in other hosts built with JUCE, 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 crashed in their first block and
  the host disabled them. On every system, the VST3 and the CLAP.
- **An Audio Unit for macOS** (R30), a third choice in the macOS installer.
- **Windows: no Visual C++ runtime needed** (R32).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):
- **A patch release, 0.1.2,** as R29: nothing a project or a preset holds has changed since
  0.1.1 (the parameters, the plug-in's IDs, the voice and the presets' format are its), so
  what was saved with 0.1.0 or 0.1.1 opens unchanged, and the installers install over
  theirs. The Audio Unit is new; its identity is R30's.
- **In R31's pull request,** a commit of its own, so that CI runs once before the tag (R29
  was a pull request of its own).
- **The version** as R29: the workspace's (`Cargo.lock` changed only in its eight crates);
  the README's status names 0.1.2, and its line on the Audio Unit names 0.1.2 rather than
  "the release after 0.1.1".
- **Released the way R29 was:** once merged, the tag `v0.1.2` on main's commit; CI's release
  job drafts the release with the Windows and Linux installers, the notices, the git sources
  and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the macOS installer, now with the Audio Unit, is built, signed and
  notarised on the release Mac (`docs/macos-release.md`) and put into the draft; the owner
  publishes it, with notes in 0.1.1's form (drafted in the pull request).

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Windows reference machine, GNU as R24),** on this change's tree
(R31 and R32, and the bump): `cargo test --workspace` 230 passed, 0 failed (25 ignored, run
by hand); `Cargo.lock` changed only in the workspace's eight crates. The installers are
CI's, on the pull request.

## R34. MIDI Learn
**The owner's request, 2026-10-06:** a focused first MIDI Learn. Each sound control (knobs,
selectors, switches) learns a hardware controller's absolute 7-bit control change on its exact
channel from its context menu, which shows the assignment and a clear waiting state, with a
keyboard-accessible list besides; Escape, Cancel and closing the editor cancel; one controller
a parameter and one parameter a controller, a controller reused moving and saying from where;
the capture message changes nothing. The wheels keep pitch bend and CC 1; the wheels, POWER,
MIDI BEND RANGE and the editor's own actions are not learned. Bank select, the modulation
wheel, data entry and RPN/NRPN, and the channel mode messages are reserved, and explained while
learning. Each parameter's own normalization; switches off at 0–63, on at 64–127; selectors
deterministic; "jump" takeover; only the dezippering learned knobs need. Saved per instance in
the host's project, versioned, by stable id, apart from the CA-72's presets (which leave it
alone); an older project opens with none, even into an instance with some; malformed,
duplicate and unknown entries handled safely; no learning saved; no global defaults. Through
nih-plug's existing MIDI path (VST3's MIDI CCs arrive as hidden parameters), the parameter set
from the audio thread so that its value, the voices, the editor and the host agree with the
editor open or closed; event timing honoured and automation's order with a controller defined;
no duplicate recording (CLAP's `DONT_RECORD`); nothing allocated, locked or waited for on the
audio thread. Deferred: relative encoders, 14-bit pairs, NRPN/RPN, MIDI 2.0, profiles, feedback
to controllers, Omni.

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):

### What is learned, and what is not
- **The list is explicit** (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/learn.rs`, `LEARNABLE`, 47): every panel
  knob (19), RANGE and WAVEFORM (6), every panel and left hand controller switch (15, NOISE's
  WHITE/PINK among them), the strip's POLY, VOICES, ENTROPY and SPREAD, and LOCK, which has no
  control and is learned from the list. That is every parameter a preset sets but the
  MODULATION wheel and MIDI BEND RANGE (a test holds the two lists together). Not learned: the
  PITCH and MODULATION wheels (pitch bend and CC 1 move them already), POWER (the host's
  bypass), MIDI BEND RANGE (the player's, R18), anything else of the editor's.
- **Reserved** (`learn::reserved`): CC 0 and 32, 1, 6 and 38, 96–101, 120–127. They go where
  they went: CC 1 the MODULATION wheel, 120, 121 and 123 as R18 has them, the others nowhere. A
  reserved controller moved while a control waits is named in the note ("CC 1 IS THE
  MODULATION WHEEL: NOT LEARNED") and the control waits on.

### Values
- A 7-bit value `v` (nih-plug gives `v / 127`; `round(x × 127)` takes it back) sets a knob to
  `v / 127` of its travel through the parameter's own normalization; a selector or VOICES to the
  position `⌊v × n / 128⌋` of its `n` (each an equal share of 0–127: RANGE's six change at 22, 43,
  64, 86 and 107), snapped by the parameter's own steps; a switch (two positions) off at 0–63, on
  at 64–127. 64 is not a knob's exact centre (64/127): TUNE sits 0.02 semitone above it, an
  oscillator's FREQUENCY 0.06 (said in the README's limitations).
- **"Jump" takeover**: the first message sets the control there. A value the parameter already
  has (a selector's other values within one position, a controller sending the same value)
  changes nothing and tells the host nothing.

### Learning
- **The audio thread only reads the assignments** (`learn::MidiMap`): a table of 16 × 128
  atomics, each the learnable parameter's index plus one. Every change is made off it under a
  mutex it never takes, which keeps at most one controller a parameter: learning a parameter
  lets its old controller go; a controller another had moves, and `Assigned` says which
  (`displaced`) and what it replaced. Removing one leaves the sound as it is.
- **The capture**: the editor arms a parameter (an atomic word, its index and the arming's
  number). The audio thread takes the next learnable control change as the one, with a
  compare-and-swap that disarms it, and posts the parameter, channel and controller in another
  atomic word; that message sets nothing. The editor assigns it at its next frame
  (`MidiMap::poll`), only if the arming is still the one caught for: armed again elsewhere or
  cancelled meanwhile, it is dropped. Until then that controller's further moves do nothing (a
  frame at most). Arming another parameter moves the learning; cancelling keeps every
  assignment. Closing the editor assigns a controller already caught (its message came) and then
  disarms, so nothing is left armed with no editor to show it; nothing of learning is saved.

### In the editor (`crates/ca72-plugin/src/learning.rs`; `ca72-panel`'s `learn.rs`)
- **A right click** on a control opens its menu, drawn over the panel in the tips' colours: its
  name and controller (`CUTOFF FREQUENCY · CH 1 · CC 74`, or `NO MIDI CONTROLLER`), **MIDI
  LEARN** (**CANCEL MIDI LEARN** while it waits), **REMOVE MIDI ASSIGNMENT** (dim with none),
  **MIDI ASSIGNMENTS…**. A strip control's opens over the panel's foot. The wheels and POWER
  open one that says why they are not learned. A press outside it only closes it; a right click
  first ends any gesture (R18); losing the window's focus closes it.
- **Waiting**: the control is ringed in the drawer's accent (dashed), on the panel or the strip,
  and a note over it says what it waits for, how to stop, and which controllers are not learned
  (or the reserved one just moved). The hover tip gives way to it. When it is learned the note
  names the controller, and the control it was taken from, for four seconds.
- **The list**: the drawer's tools gain a **MIDI** button (the search field 220 units shorter
  for it) that shows, in the presets' place, every learnable control with its controller (or
  WAITING), LEARN, REMOVE and CANCEL, the keys and the reserved controllers in the chips' row,
  and what was last done in the save row. The keyboard works it while the drawer has the keys:
  Up, Down, Page Up and Down, Home, End choose; a letter finds the next control beginning with
  it; Enter learns or cancels; Delete or Backspace removes; Escape cancels, then closes. The
  drawer opens on the presets again the next time.
- **The keyboard**: a menu opened or learning begun takes the keyboard as the drawer does (R10,
  R18, R26: baseview's focus on macOS and Windows; X11 gives the editor the keys under the
  pointer), so that Escape reaches it, and gives it back when neither is left, checked each
  frame (a controller ends learning without an event in the window).
- **Every key while it holds them** (Windows; baseview's third change,
  `third_party/baseview/PATCHES.md`): while the drawer is open or MIDI Learn holds the keyboard,
  the editor's window answers a dialog's `WM_GETDLGCODE` with `DLGC_WANTALLKEYS`; otherwise
  as before. REAPER's FX window is a dialog: there an arrow moved REAPER's focus to one of its
  own buttons, so the list never had it (found on Windows, below). The drawer's own keys
  (R10's arrows, Enter, Escape and Tab) had the same fate there, untried until now.
- `ca72-panel`'s approved image is unchanged: nothing of this is drawn at rest.

### On the audio thread
- `Ca72::process` sends a learnable control change to the table and, for an assigned one, sets
  the parameter through the host at its event's sample (`ProcessContext::set_parameter_normalized`,
  below): the parameter is at the new value at once, for the host, the editor (which reads the
  parameters each frame, R5) and the state; with the editor closed the same.
- **Dezippering, learned knobs only** (`learn::Dezip`). A 7-bit step is coarse: CUTOFF's wiper
  spans 20 V through 200 kΩ into the control node, where R51's 100 kΩ takes 0.98 V an octave,
  so the knob spans about ten octaves and a step about 0.08 (a semitone); a step of MAIN OUTPUT
  VOLUME is 0.8 % of its travel; of TUNE, 3.9 cents. **Measured** (`a_controllers_steps`, by
  hand: a held A2 sawtooth, each knob turned in a quarter of a second by the host's automation
  every 32 samples, by the controller's steps taken at once, and as built; the energy above
  8 kHz, where the note has little, against the automation's): MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME 10 to 3,
  steps **+6.64 dB** (clicks: the output's gain steps after the circuit), gliding +0.88;
  EMPHASIS 2 to 9, steps **+1.68 dB**, gliding −0.07; CUTOFF −1 to 2 at EMPHASIS 7 and 9.5,
  steps +0.02 and +0.13, gliding −0.06 and −0.16; OSCILLATOR-1 VOLUME 8 to 2 −0.01 and +0.15;
  TUNE −1 to 1 +0.03 and −0.03 (the filter and the pitch take a step without a click). The
  whole's level within 0.1 dB stepped; gliding, MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME's 1.0 dB above (its glide
  lags the turn by half of 10 ms), the others within 0.3 dB. So a glide is needed for some
  knobs and costs the others nothing measurable: every knob a learned controller moves glides
  alike, simpler to know than a list. The voices take it from where they had it to the new
  value over 10 ms (`DEZIP`), linearly, their controls set every 32 samples (`DEZIP_STEP`),
  runs no longer than that while one moves; a second message mid-glide glides on from where it
  is. Only the voices glide: the parameter jumped. Switches, selectors and VOICES do not. The
  host's automation, the editor and presets reach the voices as they always have: anything
  setting a gliding knob's parameter ends its glide there. nih-plug's smoothers are not used:
  none of the parameters has one, and giving them one would change automation's sound too.
- Nothing allocated or freed (`tests/realtime.rs`, the plug-in's own `process` with every kind
  of learned control, a capture, reserved controllers and automation ending a glide).

### Through the host (`third_party/nih-plug/PATCHES.md`, changes 10 and 11)
- **The MIDI path is nih-plug's as it was**: CLAP's MIDI events and VST3's hidden MIDI CC
  parameters (`IMidiMapping` maps every controller on every channel to one, which the wrapper
  turns into `NoteEvent::MidiCC`) reach `process` as before. Nothing is asked of a host's own
  MIDI mapping.
- **`ProcessContext::set_parameter_normalized`** (change 10) sets the parameter as each wrapper
  already sets the host's automation during a process call, and tells the host: CLAP an output
  `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE` at the change's time flagged `CLAP_EVENT_DONT_RECORD` and no gesture
  (`clap/ext/params.h`: "Turning a knob via plugin's internal MIDI mapping"), so the host shows
  the value without recording automation over the MIDI it records (nothing more: no rescan of
  the parameters, below); VST3 a point in the call's
  `outputParameterChanges` at its sample offset, VST3's way for a processor to tell its host
  and controller (Steinberg's Communication FAQ). Room for 1024 changes a call is reserved when
  the wrapper is made. No feedback loop: the plug-in tells the host only of its own changes, never
  of the host's automation, and nih-plug ignores a controller value the host sets while
  processing (R4).
- **The order at one sample** (change 10): a host's parameter change is set before the events
  the plug-in reads at its sample, in both formats, whatever the host's order (VST3 sorts by
  time, parameter changes first; CLAP splits a run before an event a parameter change follows at
  its sample). So the host's automation and a learned controller of one parameter take turns in
  time: the later holds, and at one sample the controller (set after the automation). A host
  playing automation moves the parameter back at its next point. Without the CLAP change the
  test's "listed first" case gave the automation (checked).
- **`TestProcessContext`** (change 11): a context with no host, for the plug-in's tests of
  `process`, since nih-plug keeps its parameter setters to itself.

### Saved with the project
- **`midi_map`, a persisted field** (with `preset` and the editor's width): JSON
  `{"version":1,"assignments":[{"param":"cutoff","channel":1,"cc":74}, …]}`, by the
  parameters' stable ids, the channel 1 to 16 as shown, in the list's order. A host's project
  and its presets of the plug-in hold it; the CA-72's own presets never do (R10: they hold
  parameters' values), and choosing, saving, replacing or reverting one leaves it alone.
- **Read leniently** (`learn::Saved`): anything but an object of version 1 is an empty table;
  an entry of an unknown or unlearnable parameter, a channel outside 1–16, a controller outside
  0–127 or reserved, or a parameter or controller already assigned above it in the file, is left
  out (the first kept). `Plugin::filter_state` writes a state's table back checked before it
  loads, and gives a state without one (saved before this) an empty one: nih-plug sets only the
  fields a state names, so an older project loaded into an instance with assignments would
  otherwise have kept them.
- The parameters, their ids, ranges and defaults, the voice and the presets' format are 0.1.1's:
  a project saved before opens with the same sound and no assignments.

### Tests
`learn::tests` (13: the list against the presets' parameters, every kind's conversion, the
reserved controllers, catching and assigning, cancelling, arming another, relearning and
moving, channels, the JSON both ways, malformed, duplicate and unknown entries, a state made
good, the glide); the plug-in's (`lib.rs`: a controller set at its sample through the host and
told once, the capture changing nothing, reserved controllers keeping their paths and channels
told apart, switches, selectors and VOICES, the glide and automation ending it, automation and
a controller taking turns, instances apart, a session's table and an old one's, the editor
never open in any); `tests/clap_host.rs` (a CLAP host in the test process, through the
plug-in's own entry point: the change told at its time flagged `DONT_RECORD` and no rescan
asked, the order at one sample both ways, the table out and back with the state and gone with
an older one or a broken one, instances apart); `tests/realtime.rs` (nothing allocated); the
editor's (the menu learns, cancels with Escape, removes; arming another and a controller moved;
closing cancels and keeps what was caught; the strip's controls and the wheels' and POWER's
menus; the MIDI list from the keyboard and the pointer; a right click ending a drag; on
Windows, in a real window, the window asking a dialog for every key only while the drawer or a
control's menu holds the keyboard); `presets::tests` (presets leave the assignments alone);
`ca72-panel` (a menu's items found where drawn, a menu and a note kept on the panel).

### In hosts
On the Mac each host loaded one build of the CA-72 only, named "CA-72 MIDI TEST" so as not to replace the
installed CA-72, and a virtual MIDI port sent the controllers. Kept apart:
- **Automated, no host:** everything under Tests; `tests/clap_host.rs` is the plug-in's CLAP
  entry point driven by a host in the test process (the event, its flag and time, no rescan
  asked, the order at one sample, the state).
- **By hand, Ableton Live 12.2.7 Beta, VST3 (macOS):** a control's menu, MIDI LEARN's ring and
  waiting note, CC 1 while waiting explained and the control still waiting, CC 74 learned with
  the capture changing nothing and the next value setting CUTOFF FREQUENCY, and the controller
  working with the editor closed. Recorded with Automation Arm on: the clip got the controller
  (Live's "MIDI Ctrl 74" envelope) and the track got Cutoff Frequency automation from the
  plug-in's reported values: the VST3 limit above. Played back, the clip moved CUTOFF along its
  sweep (and moving to its start sent the controller's value there), and Live marked the track's
  automation overridden. A controller on channel 2 arrived as channel 1. Saved into a set and the
  set reopened: the set's plug-in state held `"midi_map": {"version":1,"assignments":
  [{"param":"cutoff","channel":1,"cc":74}]}` beside the parameters, the reopened menu named
  `CH 1 · CC 74`, and CC 74 at 64 set CUTOFF to its centre. The drawer's MIDI list took the
  arrow keys.
- **By hand, Bitwig Studio 5.2.7, CLAP (macOS):** the controller reached the plug-in and set
  the parameter (a diagnostic build's counters: two controllers, one learned, one told), but
  Bitwig's display kept the old value. A diagnostic build sending the same event with other
  flags: with `DONT_RECORD` (flags 2 or 3) the display stayed; with none (0) it followed, and
  each value was an undo step. A values rescan after each block with a change was added for
  it (and passed the CLAP test host), never tried in Bitwig, and taken out again when the
  Audio Unit (R30) came in from main: clap-wrapper's AUv2 takes any rescan, values only too,
  for a new parameter list (`setupParameters()`, then `ParameterList`, `ParameterInfo` and
  `ClassInfo` changed), which a turning knob would have asked for many times a second. The
  Audio Unit is told each value by the event itself (`onPerformEdit`, then a
  `kAudioUnitEvent_ParameterValueChange`). So Bitwig's display does not follow a learned
  controller, a limit of Bitwig's, said in the README.
- **By hand, REAPER 7.82 on Windows 11 (the reference machine, a screen at 200 %), VST3 and
  CLAP,** the build named `CA-72 R34` (IDs of its own), bundled with MSVC as the release is, in
  a REAPER with a settings folder of its own (`-cfgfile`: the owner's audio settings, the
  plug-in folders pointed at the build). REAPER's scripts sent the MIDI
  (`StuffMIDIMessage`), the pointer's messages were posted to the editor's window, and keys
  were real (`SendInput`), sent only while REAPER's window was in front:
  - The menu (`CUTOFF FREQUENCY · NO MIDI CONTROLLER`), MIDI LEARN's ring and note, CC 1
    explained, the capture changing nothing (0.5), `CH 2 · CC 74` learned and its 127 setting
    1.0, and CC 74 on channel 1 then changing nothing: REAPER keeps the channels apart.
  - The keyboard: learning took REAPER's focus from its FX window's preset box to the editor's
    window. Before baseview's third change a real Up arrow moved the focus to a button of
    REAPER's and the list stayed; after it, Up moved the list's choice, and Down, Enter (EMPHASIS
    waiting, then `CH 1 · CC 71` learned) and Delete (removed) worked. Escape closed the FX
    window, before the change and after it, in VST3 and in CLAP (which stops learning: closing
    the editor does); with the plug-in's "Send all keyboard input to plug-in" on (`WAK 1`), it
    cancelled learning, the window stayed, and the focus went back to the preset box.
  - Recording a sweep (50 CCs of 74, 0 to 127) with the track's automation in Trim/Read: the
    item got the CCs, no envelope, and the undo history "Recorded media". In Write mode REAPER
    wrote a Cutoff Frequency envelope besides, from the VST3's reported values (46 points) and
    from the CLAP's (48), though the CLAP's are flagged `DONT_RECORD`: REAPER does not honour
    the flag. A learned move left "Edit FX parameter" as the last undo step (the capture did
    not).
  - Playback: the item's CCs moved CUTOFF (1.0 by 1.2 s); as playback stopped REAPER sent CC 74
    with 0 (a MIDI logger before the plug-in saw it), and CUTOFF followed.
  - The CLAP's project saved and REAPER started again: the menu named `CH 1 · CC 74`, and CC 74
    set CUTOFF (live MIDI reached the reopened track only once its effects changed, a MIDI logger
    added before the plug-in: REAPER's, seen once).
- **By hand, Sandyne 2.5.0.0 on Windows 11 (the reference machine), VST3 and CLAP,** the same
  `CA-72 R34` build in the user's plug-in folders (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common`, R31's
  `CA-72 R30` builds to the Recycle Bin), the clicks real (`SendInput`, Sandyne in front;
  Sandyne, built with JUCE, ignores posted ones). The owner's Moog Sub 37 sent nothing over USB
  (a MIDI monitor on its port heard no note or controller, twice), so, with the owner's
  approval, loopMIDI 1.0.16.27 (Tobias Erichsen's, its installer's signature checked) was
  installed and a port of its, `CA72 Test`, enabled as Sandyne's MIDI input; a script sent the
  controllers into it, on channel 4 as the Sub 37 is set to send:
  - Sandyne found both builds when asked to scan, put the VST3 on a track of its own (armed)
    and opened its editor in a window of its own, drawn a pixel a point (no display scale
    given: MIDI Learn's menu and note are small, as the hover tips are).
  - MIDI LEARN on CUTOFF FREQUENCY: CC 1 explained, then Sandyne's own CC 123 explained (it
    sends one at times), CC 74 on channel 4 learned (`CH 4 · CC 74`), the capture changing
    nothing; a sweep to 127 turned CUTOFF fully up and 0 fully down.
  - A real Escape cancelled learning on EMPHASIS and the window stayed: Sandyne gives the
    plug-in its keys.
  - The project saved (`.sand`, the plug-in's state in JUCE's VST3 form: its component state
    held `{"param":"cutoff","channel":4,"cc":74}`), Sandyne started again and the project
    opened: CC 74 at 127, sent with the plug-in's window shut, turned CUTOFF fully up, and the
    menu named `CH 4 · CC 74`.
  - The CLAP on a track of its own: `CH 4 · CC 75` learned and its sweep moved CUTOFF.
  - Not tried in Sandyne: recording controllers or automation, playback.
- **Not checked in a host:** a CLAP host's recording, playback and reopening on macOS; the
  Audio Unit (R30, merged while this was made) in Logic or GarageBand: its MIDI, the editor's
  learning, and what those hosts record (an AU has no "don't record" either); Escape in a host
  on macOS (the tool driving the Mac's hosts sent Escape to no application, not even to close
  Live's own menu; the editor's tests cover it); REAPER on macOS, Cubase and other hosts;
  REAPER's Touch and Latch modes; Linux. The owner stopped the checks in Bitwig after the clash
  below, kept them to Live on the Mac, and then asked for Windows.
- **Seen besides, not MIDI Learn's:** in Bitwig, which loads every plug-in into one process,
  a second, differently built CA-72 opened a blank editor. softbuffer 0.4.8's macOS backend
  defines an Objective-C class under a fixed name, `SoftbufferObserver` (objc2's
  `define_class!`), and a second copy of the library in the process cannot define it again,
  so any two plug-ins carrying their own softbuffer 0.4 in one process would meet it. Left
  for its own change.

### Not done, and why
- **VST3 has no "don't record"**: a VST3 host that writes automation for a plug-in's own
  changes may record a learned move as automation as well as the MIDI it records (Steinberg:
  "some hosts support writing of automation for parameters sent back (outputParameterChanges)").
  The alternative, `restartComponent(kParamValuesChanged)` from the GUI thread, would keep such
  hosts from recording but re-read every parameter (and nih-plug's 2,080 hidden MIDI ones) for
  each move, and the host's view would no longer follow at the move's sample; the other,
  `IMidiMapping` mapping a learned controller to its parameter in the host, would take the
  controller from nih-plug's MIDI path into each host's own, which hosts implement unevenly (and
  the request kept nih-plug's path). Left as the format's documented way, and said in the README.
  Live 12.2.7 is such a host (below).
- **Bitwig shows nothing of a value flagged not to be recorded** (above): its display of a
  learned control stays as it was until something else sets it; the sound, the plug-in's editor
  and the saved state have the value. Without the flag each move would be an undo step, and a
  rescan costs the Audio Unit its parameter list; left to Bitwig.
- **Live gave the VST3 a channel-2 controller as channel 1** (below): there a controller is
  learned as `CH 1` whatever its channel, and one CC number on two channels is one controller.
  The channel is lost before the plug-in (nih-plug's hidden parameters keep all 16 apart, and the
  plug-in's tests tell channels apart); nothing the plug-in can change.
- **CLAP, upstream and unchanged:** `handle_in_events_until` never splits a run at the first event
  of a call's queue, so a parameter change first in a block at a later sample is set from the
  block's start (seen reading it; not this change's to alter: it moves automation in every CLAP
  host).
- Deferred, as asked: relative encoders, 14-bit pairs, NRPN/RPN, MIDI 2.0, profiles, feedback to
  controllers, Omni, soft takeover, global defaults.

**Evidence (2026-10-06, the Mac: Apple M4 Pro, macOS 27.0, Rust 1.97.1; a host open, so
pluginval's editor tests skipped), on main with R30–R33 merged and the rescan taken out:**
`cargo test --workspace` 265 passed, 0 failed (26 ignored, run by hand); clippy with
`-D warnings` on the workspace, all targets, all features; `cargo fmt --all -- --check`;
`scripts/notices.py --check` (the notices unchanged: serde was linked already, `clap-sys` is for
the tests). Before the merge, `preset_render` against main's code: all 24 factory presets the
same to the bit; with nothing learned, `process` the same to the bit as the code before
(`with_nothing_learned_the_sound_is_as_before`, run again after it). `cargo xtask bundle
ca72-plugin --profile bundle` and `scripts/auv2.sh`, then `scripts/validate.sh`: clap-validator
0.4.1, 37 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped; pluginval 1.0.4 at strictness 10, SUCCESS; Steinberg's
validator (SDK 3.8.1), 47 passed, 0 failed (its bypass test prints two messages it does not
count as failures: nih-plug's controller ignores `setParamNormalized` while processing,
upstream's and untouched); auval `-strict`, AU VALIDATION SUCCEEDED; pluginval on the Audio
Unit, SUCCESS. (The Audio Unit validate.sh leaves in `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components` was
put back to the one there before.)

**Evidence on Windows (2026-10-06, the reference machine: i5-13600K, Windows 11, a screen at
200 %; Rust 1.97.1, GNU and MSVC),** this branch with baseview's third change: `cargo test
--workspace` in the desktop session 269 passed, 0 failed (26 ignored) with each toolchain,
`the_editor_asks_a_dialog_for_every_key_only_while_it_holds_them` and R28's real-window tests
among them (over SSH, with no desktop, R28's
`the_panel_is_shown_again_as_windows_repaints_its_window` sees one colour and fails: it needs
a desktop, R28); clippy with `-D warnings` on the workspace and all targets (MSVC with
`--all-features`, as CI; GNU with `--features ca72-plugin/standalone`); `cargo fmt --all --
--check`. CI's Windows job (MSVC) on the pull request, before the third change: 268 passed, 0
failed; clap-validator 36 passed, 0 failed, 8 skipped; pluginval at strictness 10, its editor
tests included, SUCCESS; Steinberg's validator 47 passed, 0 failed.

## R35. 0.1.3
**Owner decision, 2026-10-06.** "merge it and release 0.1.3 if you think it's ready to go":
MIDI Learn (R34) as 0.1.3.

**What it brings since 0.1.2** (the tag `v0.1.2`):
- **MIDI Learn** (R34): a hardware controller's control change for each sound control, from
  the control's menu or the MIDI list in the presets' drawer, kept with the project.
- **Windows: the presets' drawer and the MIDI list take the arrow keys, Enter and Tab** in a
  host whose plug-in window is a dialog, REAPER's (baseview's third change, R34).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-06** (not separately approved):
- **Ready, the agent judged:** the workspace's tests, clippy, the validators and CI pass on
  every system; MIDI Learn was tried by hand in Live 12 (VST3, macOS), REAPER 7.82 (VST3 and
  CLAP, Windows) and Sandyne 2.5 (VST3 and CLAP, Windows), and partly in Bitwig 5.2 (CLAP,
  macOS). Not tried: the Audio Unit in a host. It tells the host of a learned value as it does
  of an edit in the editor (both reach clap-wrapper as the CLAP's output values), which
  GarageBand took (R30).
- **0.1.3, as asked,** though MIDI Learn is a feature: the parameters, the plug-in's IDs, the
  voice and the presets' format are 0.1.2's, so what was saved with 0.1.0 to 0.1.2 opens
  unchanged, and the installers install over theirs. A project saved with 0.1.3 opens in an
  earlier version without its assignments (nih-plug reads only the fields it knows).
- **The version** as R29: the workspace's (`Cargo.lock` changed only in its eight crates);
  the README's status names 0.1.3, its MIDI Learn section says it is there from 0.1.3, and its
  line on the Audio Unit no longer waits for 0.1.2.
- **Released the way R29 and R33 were:** a commit of its own in R34's pull request, so that CI
  runs once before the tag; once merged, the tag `v0.1.3` on main's commit; CI's release job
  drafts the release with the Windows and Linux installers, the notices, the git sources and
  `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the macOS installer is built, signed and notarised on the release Mac
  (`docs/macos-release.md`) and put into the draft; then published, with notes in 0.1.2's
  form.

## R-CAL. A hardware reference, and the first change it settled
**Owner decision, 2026-10-07.** The CA-72 is matched to the owner's hardware reference, a
modern recreation of the instrument which the owner could not tell from a Model D in
level- and pitch-matched recordings: "if we match this, that this will be the right thing to
do." The comparisons with hardware become measurements ([calibration](calibration/README.md)).

**Agent decisions, 2026-10-07 and 08** (not separately approved):
- **Change the circuit, never the output:** a difference is traced to a component, trim or
  device model, the netlist and the real-time model change together within their budgets
  against ngspice, and the change is recorded as a deviation from the drawing. Calibration
  is copied; the reference's own features are not targets.
- **The rig:** the MOTU 828ES on the Mac (on Linux its class-compliant USB shifted the
  captured channels once playback started beside a capture), two ES-3 for gates and
  control voltages on the inputs' clock, one stream for stimuli and responses; captures and
  renders on the lab's share, measured by the same code (`scripts/calibration/`,
  `ca72-lab stim`).
- **What the panel at its home settings showed** (oscillators off, EMPHASIS 0): the filter's
  response against its corner matches within 0.7 dB from 600 Hz to 3.6 kHz; the loudness
  contour's attack, held level and decay match with its knobs fitted; with DECAY off one
  contour's release has the reference's shape. Differences that need the knobs moved (the
  corner's mapping, the thump's size, EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME's taper, the trigger delay from
  MIDI) wait for a session at the instrument.
- **One change: an R1401 for each contour** (`ContourCircuit::dump_each`, board2.md B2-6).
  Through the drawing's one R1401 a contour held higher halved the other's release with
  DECAY off; the reference's is the same whatever the other contour holds. It changes the
  four presets with DECAY off; every other preset renders the same to the bit.
- **The knob session, 2026-10-08** (sessions C to H; the owner's instructions: trace each
  difference to a component, a trim or a device model, netlist and model together, one
  commit each). Changed: the oscillators' external control input to 50.5K (a volt an
  octave); RANGE (R39) to the reference's 0.559; oscillator 3's R162 to 2.96K (its pitch with
  OSC. 3 CONTROL off); and, measured on the reference in place of the generic tapers (A9),
  the laws of EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME (R9), EMPHASIS (R14), the four ATTACK and DECAY pots and
  the mixer's VOLUME; and, at the owner's go, the external preamplifier's R61 to 232K (its
  gain 0.97 dB up). The 8 and 12 ms keyboard delays stay.
  What still differs is listed in the calibration README.
- **The number** of this record is a placeholder until the merge.
