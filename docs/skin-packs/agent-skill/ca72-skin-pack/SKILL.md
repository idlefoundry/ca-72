name: ca72-skin-pack
description: Make, change or update a skin pack for Idle Foundry's CA-72 synthesizer plug-in, a folder (delivered as a .ifskin pack file) with skin.toml, layout.toml, an SVG drawing, pictures and fonts that changes how the CA-72's editor looks. Use when someone asks for a CA-72 skin, look, theme, panel layout or skin pack, or wants to move its controls, recolour its panel, draw over it or replace its pictures. Starts from the CC0 starter, checks the pack with check_pack after every change, and keeps the licence and provenance honest.

# Making a CA-72 skin pack

*This skill is dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0. It is a draft and may change with
the format.*

A skin pack changes how the CA-72's editor looks: where each of the panel's 44 controls is,
how each looks, the legends, rules and titles printed on the panel, a drawing over it, the
realistic look's pictures and the typeface. It holds **artwork and declarative data only,
never code**. It cannot change the sound, presets, MIDI or anything a session saves.

The format's authority is `docs/skin-packs.md` in the CA-72's repository (CC0). When this
skill and that document disagree, the document wins: tell the user about the difference.

## What you need

- A clone of the CA-72's repository with skin-pack support (`docs/skin-packs.md` and
  `docs/skin-packs/starter` exist), and a Rust toolchain. Find it, or ask the user where it is.
  Call its root `$CA72` below.
- A folder for the pack **outside the repository**, named in lower case with `-`
  (`night-panel`). Call it `$PACK`. You always work in a folder; a pack file
  (`night-panel.ifskin`, a ZIP of the folder) is only for delivery (step 6).
- If you cannot run commands, say so plainly and ask the user to run each check and send you
  its output and both preview pictures. Never guess what a check would say.

Read `docs/skin-packs.md` once before the first change. The reference files beside this one
hold what you'll look up as you go:

- [reference/layout.md](reference/layout.md): coordinates, the 44 controls by kind, their click
  areas and spacing, fixtures, legends, rules and titles.
- [reference/drawing.md](reference/drawing.md): the SVG subset, the drawing's coordinates
  (offset 130 from the layout's, or the wooden strip's own height with a `[panel]` size),
  picture slots and fonts.
- [reference/provenance.md](reference/provenance.md): the manifest, licences, provenance for
  generated work, declarations, ids, versions and updates, signatures, and what must never go
  in a pack.
- [reference/findings.md](reference/findings.md): each check finding, what it means and what
  to do about it.

## Rules that are never bent

1. **Start from a copy of the CC0 starter**, `$CA72/docs/skin-packs/starter`. Never copy,
   trace or closely follow the official layout (`crates/ca72-panel/packs/official/`), the
   plug-in's pictures (`crates/ca72-panel/assets/`) or a pack written by `export_pack`: they
   are under the GPL, and a pack made from them is under the GPL too. If the user wants that,
   stop and tell them it needs the GPL or Idle Foundry's permission, and that this skill does
   not make such packs.
2. **Don't change the CA-72's repository.** Work only in `$PACK`.
3. **Check after every change** (below), look at both previews, and keep going until there is
   no Rejected finding.
4. **Never add a price** or store data (`price`, `currency`, `sku`, `license_key`, `drm`). A
   pack never states a price.
5. **No trademarks or other makers' branding**: no instrument maker's names, logos or model
   names (in legends, titles, drawings, pictures, the pack's name, id or summary), and no
   imitation of another maker's trade dress. Describe a style in general words instead
   ("1970s silver panel"), and tell the user why.
6. **No font, stock picture, texture, icon or clip art unless its licence permits this
   distribution**, including sale if the pack may be sold. Never download one from an
   unknown site. If unsure, leave it out and use the built-in typeface.
7. **Record provenance honestly.** What you made is `origin = "generated"` with the `tool`
   named (your product and model). Never call your work the user's `original`, and never
   leave a file without an `[[assets]]` entry.
8. **Declarations are not clearance.** Never fill in `[declarations]` for the user or sign
   them in their name. Only the user can declare, for themselves, once they mean it. Never
   tell anyone a pack is "cleared", "approved" or "safe to sell": the checks clear nothing,
   a signature only shows who published the files, and a marketplace's review decides.
9. **Signatures are the marketplace's.** Never write, edit or copy a `signature.toml`, and
   never run `pack_keygen` or `pack_sign`. Never edit a signed pack (one with a
   `signature.toml`): a pack changed after signing is refused. Work on an unsigned copy
   instead (step 2), and remove `signature.toml` only from the user's own copy, after telling
   them it will then load as unsigned. A signature is neither copy protection nor a licence.
10. **Publish nothing.** Don't upload, share or install the pack without the user's yes.

## The steps

### 1. Ask what they want, briefly

The look (colours, mood, era, materials), the arrangement (keep the starter's three rows, or
regroup), classic (drawn controls) or realistic (pictures), the pack's name, the creator's
name to credit, and the licence the user chooses (suggest CC0-1.0 or CC-BY-4.0 if they have
no view; the choice is theirs). Make sensible guesses for anything they leave open and say
what you guessed.

### 2. Copy the starter and make it the user's

```bash
cp -R "$CA72/docs/skin-packs/starter" "$PACK"
```

To **change an existing pack** of the user's instead, work on a copy of its folder. If they
give you a `.ifskin`, check it first (`check_pack` reads it as it is, without unpacking it; if
the check rejects it as an archive, don't unpack it), then unpack it into a new, empty
folder (`unzip <name>.ifskin -d "$PACK"`; it may hold one folder at its top) and run nothing
found in it. If it has a `signature.toml`, follow rule 9. Keep its `id`; see "Updating a pack"
below.

For a new pack, in `$PACK/skin.toml`:

- `id`: lower case and dotted, the user's own reverse-DNS name
  (`org.<their-name>.<pack-name>`), and it stays the same for every version. Never
  `org.example.*`. Never `com.idlefoundry.*`: those ids load only with Idle Foundry's
  first-party signature, and the built-in looks' own ids never load.
- `name` (as the settings menu lists it, capitals suit the panel), `version = "1.0.0"`,
  `summary`.
- `license` and `license_files`: put the chosen licence's full text in `LICENSE.txt`. Keep a
  copy of the starter's CC0 notice only if the pack stays CC0.
- `[[creators]]`: the user (ask how to credit them). Credit your own part honestly in the
  assets' provenance, not as a creator with a person's name.
- Update `README.md` to describe this pack (`.md` files need no provenance).
- Leave out `requires`. Add `requires = "ca-72 >= x.y.z"` only if the pack truly needs a
  later CA-72 than the one it is checked with: an earlier one will refuse it.

In `$PACK/layout.toml`, keep `controls = 3` as the starter has it. It names the revision of the
CA-72's controls the layout was made for, so that a later CA-72 can place controls added since.

### 3. Run the first check

```bash
cd "$CA72" && cargo run --release -p ca72-panel --example check_pack -- "$PACK" "$PACK/../preview.png"
```

Write the previews **outside `$PACK`** (a PNG left inside becomes part of the pack and needs
provenance). The first build takes a few minutes; run it in the background if your tools
time out. If it fails to *build*, the problem is in the repository, not the pack: don't
edit the repository; tell the user (someone may be changing it), and use a `check_pack`
binary already built (`target/release/examples/check_pack`) if there is one. The check
prints each finding (`rejected`, `review` or `note`, a code, the file and
why), then `LOADS:` or `REJECTED:`, and writes `preview.png` and `preview-large.png`.

### 4. Change one thing at a time, and check again

Work in small steps: the arrangement, then the rules and legends, then the drawing, then
pictures or a font. Edit the TOML by hand or line by line; a regular expression over
`[[control]]` blocks breaks on the `[` in arrays. Generating the drawing's coordinates with
a short script is fine: keep the script outside `$PACK`. After each:

1. Run the check.
2. After any change to an SVG (the drawing or a picture), see what it costs to draw:
   ```bash
   cd "$CA72" && cargo run --release -p skin-pack --example svg_cost -- "$PACK/art/panel.svg"
   ```
   It shows the drawing's counts and its time to draw, then the same with each costly kind of
   part left out. `work` is the cost in pixel-equivalents, against a limit of 60 million. A picture is
   costed at its slot's width: pass it after the file (`... pictures/knob.svg 512`). Keep well
   under the limit; tall or diagonal lines (stripes, hatching) and big filtered or
   see-through areas are what cost (see [reference/drawing.md](reference/drawing.md)).
3. **Open and look at both previews**, `preview.png` (standard lettering) and
   `preview-large.png` (large lettering). Look for: legends running into dials, knobs or each
   other; dial numbers clipped by neighbours; titles not over their group; the drawing's bands
   or shapes not lined up with the controls (remember the 130 offset, or the `[panel]`'s wood), or crossing a legend;
   poor contrast between print and drawing, or controls that vanish into it (black rockers
   on a dark face); anything cut off at the panel's edges.
4. Fix what you see as well as what the check reports. The check knows click areas and
   limits, not taste: a pack can load and still look crowded.

The preview shows the whole editor. Only the wooden strip and the face above the lower wood
are the pack's; the lower strip with VOICES, STEREO and OUTPUT and the left-hand column are
the plug-in's own and can't be changed.

### 5. Settle every finding

- **Rejected**: the plug-in will not load the pack. Fix every one. See
  [reference/findings.md](reference/findings.md).
- **Review**: the pack loads, but a marketplace's review must look at it before listing it.
  Fix those that are mistakes (a file without provenance, a missing licence text). Explain
  each one that remains to the user in plain words: what it means and why it is there. Some
  are expected and right for an AI-made pack (`provenance.generated`,
  `declaration.missing`). Never hide one by recording something untrue.
- **Note**: for the record, but **read every note**. A layout or `[look]` field the plug-in
  doesn't know is only noted (`layout.unknown`, `look.unknown`), so a typo (`colour` spelt
  `color`, `bigg = true`) loads without it and with nothing but a note. In a pack you made,
  every such note is a mistake: fix it. Mention the rest the user would want to know (a font's
  vendor or trademark, a picture drawn at other proportions).

### 6. Deliver it as a pack file

When the user wants one file to share or to hand to a marketplace:

1. Check the folder one last time: no Rejected finding, both previews looked at.
2. Write the pack file **outside** `$PACK`:
   ```bash
   cd "$CA72" && cargo run --release -p skin-pack --example pack_archive -- "$PACK" "$PACK/../<pack-name>.ifskin"
   ```
3. Check the pack file the same way, with previews:
   ```bash
   cd "$CA72" && cargo run --release -p ca72-panel --example check_pack -- "$PACK/../<pack-name>.ifskin" "$PACK/../preview.png"
   ```
   Its findings should match the folder's. If they don't, tell the user what differs.

Keep the folder: it is what you change next time. Never add a `signature.toml`; a marketplace
signs a pack once its review passes, and an unsigned pack loads for anyone who installs it.

### Updating a pack

An update keeps the pack's `id` and raises its `version` (`major.minor.patch`: patch for
fixes, minor for additions, major for a new look). Its layout keeps its `controls` value
unless you remake it for a newer revision of the CA-72's controls (then place every control
that revision has). The plug-in uses the newest version of an
id installed more than once, so the update can sit beside the old one. A signed pack is always
preferred over an unsigned copy of the same id, whatever version the copy claims: tell the
user that their unsigned update of a published pack won't show while the signed one is
installed, until the marketplace signs the update.

### 7. Hand it over

Tell the user, briefly: where the pack (and its `.ifskin`, if made) is; the last check's
verdict and each remaining Review finding with its explanation; what you generated (every asset with `origin = "generated"`);
the previews (attach or show both); and how to install it if they want to try it
(`docs/skin-packs.md`, "Installing"). Offer to install it only for their own use; do it only
on their yes. Remind them that whether a generated work is protected, and so licensable,
differs between countries, and that declarations, when the time comes, are theirs to make.
